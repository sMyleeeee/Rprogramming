"1","GamingChair","GTRACING Gaming Chair with Footrest","Hyperion","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2022","","I purchased this to set up my new office. After combing through the vast selection of other chairs and all the reviews, I decided on this chair and I could not be happier.Before I launch into my assessment of the chair, I just want to say that you should absolutely buy it if you are thinking about purchasing this particular one. I have had many desk chairs of varying prices, sizes, features, etc. and this chair has thoroughly impressed me.Let's start with the assembly, which was so easy and straightforward. I saw some complaints about having a hard time with setting it up, but honestly, just use your brain and all will be ok. I am sure many could set this up without the instructions, which I did until I got to setting up the built-in speakers.I sit in this chair daily for hours and it is SO comfortable. Being able to adjust the back to several different angles is fantastic. The head and lumbar pillows are also great at giving some added support; they never feel like they're in the way. Reclining the chair to its furthest extent offers a very comfortable resting position, and, along with the added foot rest, it truly is a remarkably comfy ""recliner"" chair. The armrests are adjustable and offer some rotation so you can find the sweet spot for yourself.The built-in speakers are nifty too. **Disclaimer: You must buy the Bluetooth USB Receiver to utilize this feature.** I wasn't expecting much from them, but I do find myself switching to use them for certain entertainment purposes like listening to background music while I work or when I am playing specific games, in particular horror or racing games. The sound is way better than I anticipated, though they do lack bass. The relay unit lasts for hours (days usually for me) and charges quickly enough to never create frustration.Some other notes:-I saw a few complaints about the packaging and indentations created from remaining bundled up in the box. However, I did not experience this at all. All of the cushioned pieces came out of the box well packaged and without blemishes of any kind.-There was an odor initially when taking it out of the box. Ya know, that warehouse smell. After an hour or so, the smell had completely dissipated.-In regards to the Top Critical Review for this chair; That customer is absolutely insane and I cannot fathom what they were expecting for a chair in this price range. I used to have a fancy $980 chair provided from my employer, the largest social media entity. Comparatively, I am far happier with this chair. Yes, there are some plastic parts (dust covers, gas lift cover, armrests) but the expensive chair had the same plastic components. I feel less tension in my lower back after spending 6+ hours in this chair vs the expensive one where I would find myself getting up to walk around every so often to relieve the pain in my lower back. Oh, and they had mentioned missing parts due to the box being damaged (which has no bearing on the product itself); those particular items cannot be lost as they are attached to the chair and in a special pouch located on the back of the chair (see photo). They obviously didn't realize that.All-in-all, this is an excellent purchase for anyone who is looking at a new desk chair. The price is phenomenal for the quality and the amount of features. There is also a good amount of colors to choose from so you can better match your style and decor.",5,NA
"2","GamingChair","GTRACING Gaming Chair with Footrest","Hyperion","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022","","I’ve watched a lot of YT videos of this chair but was hesitant to order online but for $160 how bad could it be?Similar style chairs in Office Max start around $300 but with bonded leather which is commonly known to peel and tear over time.This is PU leather which is not as breathable but sturdy like vinyl without cracking or peeling.First off, assembly is extremely straight forward with incredible step by step instructions.  Hats off to whoever put it together.The seat is surprisingly comfortable and sturdy, as the YT reviews suggested but much more comfortable than I would’ve expected.  I needed a more firm and supportive chair so don’t expect to sink in and be plushy.Every video BASHED the speaker quality comparing it to laptop equivalence. I had low expectations and thought it was more of a gimmick but these are actually louder and having more bass than what YT videos would have you think.  Don’t expect full Bose type quality but for the size of the speakers I would compare it to a smaller JBL flip. These speakers DO NOT distort at high volumes or deep bass (my music of choice is EDM)My only complaint is the foot rest, I wouldn’t pay the money for it.  I’m 5”10 with slightly longer legs than normal and the footrest is more of a calf rest.  My feet hang off and I wish it could come out a few more inches.  The foot rest is not that sturdy and has some give. It’s not well crafted and not really worth using by if you’re under 5’10 than this May suit you well.All in all, exceptional quality, easy to assemble and I would definitely look into this as a really good alternative to the Respawn 110",5,NA

The assembly was a breeze thanks to the awesome manual that came with it.  It is very comfortable, and I love that it has such a wide recline range! The lumbar and head pillows are adjustable and are very supportive. The footstool is pretty decent, could be a bit longer for taller folks but it does okay, plus I don't plan to use that part too often.  The quality of the speakers is pretty good for the price of the chair and work great for meetings, watching YouTube, or streaming your favorite music. Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend.",5,NA

"11","GamingChair","RESPAWN 110 Gaming Chair","Heather Garrison","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2020","","8-13-22I abuse this chair, and it just won’t die! I still love it!I have gained a bit of weight since I got this chair, but I have never stopped flopping into it full dead weight, and it always takes it with ease!I sit in it sideways with my head on one arm and my legs propped up on or draped over the other.I push against the back way harder than I should while seated to stretch out my back, it has never even hinted at slipping/breaking.My grandkids push each other around on our hardwood floors, spinning it roughly and intentionally into other furniture.The arms now wiggle a bit, and a screw fell off it which I could not ever figure out where it fell from; other than that this chair is flawless!The hydraulics still work flawlessly.The reclining mechanism still works flawlessly.The upholstery basically still looks like it did when it was new; and the cushioning is still cushiony.I rarely use the leg rest so it still functions as new.Highly recommend this chair!2-22-20I am still head over heals in love with this chair and stand by my original 5 star rating.My original concerns are  addressed here:STITCHING - The stitching has held up beautifully!  I am super rough on this chair, I sit cross legged on it while wearing Doc Marten boots with metal clasps and drag my feet across the seat constantly.  The stitching has not been affected at all by this (nor has the PU leather for that matter).ARM STABILITY - A week in the right arm became wobbly, I discovered the screws were loose, tightened them and the arm has not wobbled since.  NOTE:  I am super rough on the right arm in particular.  I often sit slightly sideways in the chair leaning my full 140 pounds against that arm, and in order to adjust the recline I have lean over the arm at the waist to reach the lever, again pushing against the arm with my full 140 pound weight.LEG REST- The leg rest is used frequently and I quite often forget to be gentle with it.  Despite this the leg rest is no more wobbly than the day I put the chair together.This chair is proving to be a fantastic buy for the money, much better than I had even hoped!  I would most definitely repeat this purchase!Original review follows:1-15-2020  The chair arrived right on schedule.  I have been in possession of it for 3.5 hours, and am sitting in it now writing this review.Facts to consider when reading this review:> I am a 5'2"" woman of average build - 10 pounds overweight is average right - in my 40's>  I have very short arms> I have absolutely no upper body strength to speak of.>  I am NOT A GAMER - I bought this chair for use at my writing desk and watching television> Any numeric ratings in this review are on a scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being the worst and 10 being the bestPACKAGING  > RATING: 10 <>  It was like Tetris inside that box, with each individually wrapped stuffed component, and two boxes of hardware  being separated  by simple sheets of cardboard.  There was absolutely no Styrofoam - it was beautiful!>  Despite appearing like a tightly packed Tetris board I had absolutely no trouble getting everything out of the box,  even with my complete lack of upper body strength.EASE OF ASSEMBLY  > Rating:  11 <> From sealed box to fully assembled in about an hour  > This includes unboxing, taking inventory, sorting and arranging the components in the order and groups they  would be needed  > OCD what can I say <  >  I completed the entire assembly by myself, completed unattended with one exception:  >  I had boyfriend hold the back in place while I got the screws that hold it to the seat started - I only got them  started enough to stay put, then sent the boyfriend away, but I could have done it alone if necessary  >  I could actually follow the instructions ... I am, unfortunately, stereotypically female when it comes to  following instructions that contain only pictures with no text at all - these instructions were over the top easy  to followINITIAL INSPECTION AFTER ASSEMBLY  > RATING: 9.9 <>  Every component, from the upholstered pieces to the washers in the tool kit, was in pristine condition>  All joints and connection points were flawlessly aligned, smooth and sturdy>  It is very visually appealing and identical to the images the seller supplied on it's page  >  NOTE:  I did not use the wheels it came with as we have hardwood floors, so I had also ordered inline skate wheels  at the same time and used them instead - it should be further noted that the wheels appeared to be pristine and  are being saved for use on another piece of furniture in the future>  Loss of .01 in rating due to the thread used in the stitching looking thinner than I would expect for a chair of this  price and quality design/manufacturing  > It should be noted that I had read about feature on several ""Top Ten Gaming Chairs of 2019"" websites so I was not  surprised to note thisFUNCTIONALITY  > RATING: 9.25 <>  I cannot rate the wheels, as I mentioned earlier I have not yet used them.  They were therefore completed excluded  from the rating.> The seat is very comfortable, the padding is very firm, but gives just the right amount for me to feel like it stay comfy for a good long time - when comparing this note to other reviews remember I am 5'2"" and about 130 pounds fully clothed  >  Due, I assume, to my size, I am unable to lower the chair! LOL  Apparently I do not weigh enough to activated the  hydraulics!  LOL  Being a little overweight, I was quite pleased with this discovery, but, to be fair no extra points were added to the rating for this.>  The seat back contour was very well designed.  Again, due to my stature - and I keep mentioning this because so  many of the reviews seem to be written by big and tall men - it doesn't ""hug"" me like it is designed to do,  HOWEVER, it is still quite comfortable.  The contour was apparently designed around the center of the seat in a  slope so that I can still feel the hint of the hug.>  My feet do not touch the floor in the lowest position!  LOL  I knew from the dimensions that the seller provided on  the page that this would be the case.  No points were deducted for this.>  The arms that are mentioned in almost every review as being wobbly, are, at least at 3 hours into use not wobbling  at all, but definitely feel like they could more secure.  > This has been mentioned to varying degree in almost ever review I read and I visited and read reviews at four top  ten websites, Amazon, Walmart, Sams, Costco, and about a half dozen other random websites.  >  Loss of .25 in rating for mediocre arm stability>  The lumbar support just got in my way.  The seat back has enough of ""bump"" in just the right place for me.  I am  saving it for possible later in the chair's life.  No rating points deducted, this is just personal preference.>  The head rest is nowhere near in the right place for me and I am not using it, although I am saving it for possible use  on something else down the line.  Again, personal preference, no points deducted.> The leg rest is an AWESOME FEATURE!  It was most definitely a selling point for me.  >  The farthest edge of the leg rest falls at the very top of my ankle and is very comfortable. > I am 5'2"" <  >  Engaging and retracting the leg rest is apparently a learned skill and at 3 hours in I am still a little stop and go.  >  No points deducted as I can tell it operator learning curve and not a mechanical problem.>  In the retracted position the leg rest mechanism feels extremely secure.>  In the engaged position it is obvious that the arms holding it to the underside of the seat are not as secure as they  should be; enough so that I worry about accidentally putting too much weight on the leg rest and snapping the  arms off their mount.  >  The arms are attached to the seat bottom much too close to the edge of the seat; if the back end of the arms  were longer and mounted further back on the seat bottom they would be much sturdier.  > Loss of 0.5 points deducted from the rating for insecure mounting of leg rest.>  EASE OF CONTROL  >RATING: 10<  >  Reclining and return action is very smooth with only minimal learning curve.  I was a pro in less than a minute.  >  The Recline Lock and Height Lock controllers are just barely within my comfort zone of reach, I have to lean over  the side quite a bit to reach them.  Furniture is not designed for short people, no points deducted.  >  I cannot speak to the wheels as I am not using them, and they were not included in the rating.OVERALL RATING:  9.85Please forgive any typos, I am sure I missed some.  LOLI will come back in a few weeks/months with an update to this review,",5,NA

It's not a bad chair. It was really easy and straight forward as far as assembly goes and only took about 30 minutes. Feels pretty solid and sturdy (for a 6'7"", 350 lb dude). The only complaint I have is the seat cushion is a bit too soft and my butt gets sore after a couple of hours of sitting in it, which I see as a good thing actually, since I believe that people should get up and move around every now and then instead of sitting in front of their PC all day, get the blood flowing again you know?.If you see it the way I see it, then this chair will be a good fit for you. Good price, quick assembly, rolls smooth and everything works exactly the way it should. Box had some wear when it got to me, but no big deal.",4,NA

"15","GamingChair","RESPAWN 110 Gaming Chair","ricky barela","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2022","","Hello Chair Shoppers!Right before the pandemic, I bought a $50 chair from a large company the retails furniture. I won't mention any names, but they are a large Warehouse, specializing in Furniture, and they are American.Anyways... It was the cheapest chair there (but about $70), and, at the time, it seemed to tick all the boxes for what I needed. A couple of months later, I began working my day job from home, as well as another roughly 40 hours a week doing my second ""job,"" solo game development.I ended up spending about 16 hours a day in that chair... upwards of 20... and I paid the price for it. I ended up with Hip Bursitis, and I've been walking with a cane for the last month or so, healing up.Obviously, the chair wasn't fully to blame. I should've taken more stretch breaks, excersized more, etc... Fast forward to the end of November (Right before the Hip Bursitis struck) and I mentioned to my mother that I was shopping for a chair. She ended up offering to buy me one for a Christmas present, and I decided to go with this Respawn Chair, primarily because of the inclusion of the FOOT REST (to put my leg up and stretch out throughout the day).When I got the chair, I was blown away. easy to put together, fantastic materials, and just head and shoulders above my old chair (granted, my old chair was the cheapest one I could find brand new).I am SO glad I upgraded. I love my new chair. A few days after purchasing, however, I cracked the Foot Rest a tiny bit. The jury is still out on whose fault it was.... but office chairs are pricey, and I figured I would take a stab at getting a replacement part.When I sent in the form to possibly get the Foot Rest part replaced, I was replied to immediately. Even though it was between Christmas and New Years, I received the replacement part within days.Dealing with Respawn has been a fantastic Customer Experience, and I couldn't be happier with my new chair.THANKS RESPAWN!",5,NA

"24","GamingChair","AA Products Gaming Chair High Back Ergonomic Computer","Alex Desmarais","Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2019","","I was using the crappiest chair so this was a major upgrade. I have already taken one nap in it and slept well (the foot rest is amazing). I wish the bottom cushion was a bit more comfortable but I am being incredibly nitpicky. The chair also seems to be of solid construction so far. The only thing I think is a potential con is if you are not confident in building things because the chair came quite dis-assembled and took some time to put together (about an hour or so). If you are not comfortable with building things either go a different direction or be prepared to get some help. Otherwise I think great for the cost. I imagine other gaming chairs with the same quality and features are more around the $200 mark so this is great for someone who does not want to spend $400 on a chair but still wants features, comfort, and quality.",5,NA
"25","GamingChair","AA Products Gaming Chair High Back Ergonomic Computer","Dave","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2021","","It came quickly in the mail within four days. it only took us  30 minutes to assemble it and I didn’t even need the instructions - come on it’s a chair with only a few pieces to assemble lol and it was very easy to follow the directions if you needed to refer back. Of course I am kind of a handy guy with tools, but even if you have a little bit of experience you shouldn’t have a problem putting this chair together there’s really not that many pieces to assemble. I’ve seen people write some reviews saying that they took two hours to figure it out and that’s just ridiculous. It’s really comfortable and fun to use. It has a lot of options like recline, extra padding for lumbar support and neck support and it’s, fully adjustable, and very well-made, and most importantly priced fairly. I’ve seen chairs go for way more and this one is just as good.Im going to get another for office at my garage. It’s so sporty looking! I keep seeing people say this thing breaks? Well, I’m 220lbs and five feet eleven and I didn’t break the foot rest like these other people who must be slam dancing in the chair all night lol come on guys this is a 200 dollar middle of the road chair that’s giving you a lot of nice options and features, AND for a fair price! This isn’t a premium office chair you’ll find in a law firm, bank, or executives conference room, those chairs are usually 1000 dollars folks. I’m also buying the matching desk they make too right after I’m done posting this review. Because I’ve bought many office chairs over the years and I’m having the most fun with this one. And yes, this chair is best fitted for certain “frame types” let’s say, but I’m no small guy and I take care of my stuff that I buy and I’m not rough with it. It’s great for gaming for a few hours and  he’ll yeah as well as kicking back the recline feature and talking on the phone lol I’m so buying another chair for my office at the garage and a desk too! I wanna look cool over there and this chair screams racing!  I don’t care if it lasts only a few years, or maybe it will be last more since I take good care of things,  I’m not using it to go on a ship into outer space with the dam thing! I don’t need a five hundred dollar elite brand chair for my every day work. A buddy of mine has the same chair in his garage with a rough edged floor, grease, and chemicals and he’s had his chair a whole year beating on it and it never broke, I don’t know what these people are doing with the chair but they can’t be treating them correctly. So pound for pound and option for option, this was the best deal going. And anyone who says this chair is less then four stars surely doesn’t know what there talking about. I sat on this chair six hours today and the padding and pillows were satisfactory. Of course my leg was a bit sore because heck, nobody should sit for that long on any chair!lol  But for the money, and the design, I think this chair is just fine.",5,NA

"28","GamingChair","AA Products Gaming Chair High Back Ergonomic Computer","Doris","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024","","A disaster of a transaction all around and I strongly urge anyone paying attention not to buy this.The building process is awful, screws don't easily go into holes, instructions aren't clear, etc. It took me 5-6 hours to get it built and this is the 4th chair like this I've had so I like to think I know what I am doing.Once built, the 2 most important parts didn't work. The lever for the back of the chair did nothing, thus the back stood straight up with zero give to lean back. Also, the gas canister under the seat part did not work so there as no ability to raise/lower the seat.I took out a 2-year warranty/protection plan thankfully. HOWEVER, ran into more issues with that. The company claimed they sent it, was scheduled for delivery on Feb. 6 arriving independently from the chair. This got delayed until Feb. 8. Then Feb. 9. Finally on Feb. 13 I checked and the tracking number indicated it might be lost.Amazon contacted the company to open a case and have the respond/get me out a new protection plan/paperwork but instead of discussing and doing this the VERY QUICKLY canceled my 2-year protection plan and issued a refund without even consulting me.So, for a brief while, I had a defective chair that did not work at all and no protection plan to apply for a refund.Thankfully, Amazon took care of it and refunded me everything but urged me to write this.I suspect this company is a scam. The price of the chair is so low for a reason. Cause it's a bad product that doesn't work well. The company knows this, they know most won't take out a warranty for such a cheap item. I did, which had them worried so they quickly canceled/refunded it once they knew I had an issue with the chair and would want to use this warranty for a refund.BUYER BEWARE",5,NA

The ergonomic design is on point, and the footrest is a game-changer (pun intended). Whether you're gaming or working, you'll appreciate the support it provides.The reclining feature is also a nice touch. Being able to adjust the angle is great for preventing stiffness during long sessions. And the swivel and rocker functions? Super convenient.Now, onto durability. While the chair feels solid overall, there are a few areas that could be improved. Some users have reported issues with the armrests feeling a bit wobbly, and the fabric can be prone to wear and tear over time.And let's talk about that navy blue color. It's stylish, sure, but it might not be to everyone's taste. Personally, I love it, but I can see how some people might prefer something a bit more neutral.Overall, I'd give the GTRACING Footrest, Ergonomic Computer Game Desk, Reclining Gamer Chair a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It's comfy, supportive, and built to last, but it's not without its minor flaws. If you're in the market for a gaming chair, it's definitely worth considering.",4,NA

"50","GamingChair","BestOffice High-Back Gaming Chair PC","Katherine","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","Excellent though a bit snug!","I'm a big believer in ""you get what you pay for"" and I usually advise to save up, make one purchase, make one investment and don't worry about it for a few years. But something about this chair's value really scales, especially if you can grab it on sale. I got mine in white for $75 including tax and shipping. Many quality gaming chairs cost hundreds of dollars. There a handful of cheap office chairs you can snag for $60. This chair compared to one of those generic office chair is worth the extra $15. If you're looking at this chair for $90 or higher, then the former statement is true (save up). Anyway. I've had this chair for a day now and it isn't perfect. I'll go over what I like and what I don't like.Appearance: It looks nice. Doesn't look or feel too cheap. The base is metal with plastic feet. Many chairs have plastic base with plastic feet.+1ptFunctionality: This chair has a handful of features--You can adjust the height. +1ptBut it only has about a 3in range -1ptIt has a lock to let you remain upright and can be unlocked so you can recline back. +1ptIt does NOT have a way to lock in the reclined position. -1ptComfort: This chair is pretty comfy. It has a removable/adjustable head pillow and a removable/adjustable lumbar pillow as well. +1ptIt is a little stiff. Some people may like that. It also may break it after a while. I've only had it one day so I will update if something new develops. The chair has a *mostly* comfortable width to me. It measures 19"" for arm to arm. But it has this little ""cushion"" that tries to contour your legs that makes it a little uncomfortable to sit with my legs spread even a little. I have to keep my knees closer together than I normally would to keep the ""cushion"" from digging into the side of my legs. Because of this, there is really only about 16"" of room for your butt or the sides of your thighs. I'm about 5'10"" Male 215lbs size 38 pants XL shirt. I think I am at the cusp of being able to comfortably sit in this. It was not made with larger people in mind. It does state a 250lb weight limit while we're on the topic. -1ptAssembly: I've assembled several office chairs before and this process was similar and just as easy. +1ptIf you aren't experienced or if you struggle with Ikea stuff, you may find it difficult. The hardware that they include is kinda junk. If you have the luxury of using your own hardware (or hand tools at least), I would highly recommend it. I had one bolt that had really junky threads from the factory and I couldn't do much about it, just had to cross thread it and tighten it the best I could. I had another bolt that stripped and the thread never would grab. Luckily there was one extra included in the packaging and I ended up being able to tighten it without cross threading. I think I got lucky. 90% of the assembly was smooth sailing and the few snags that arose, I knew exactly what to do. Again, if you aren't experienced with this, it could easily turn into a headache and a return to amazon over poor quality hardware",5,NA

"56","GamingChair","BestOffice High-Back Gaming Chair PC","Charles","Reviewed in Canada on July 24, 2024","Its much better than nothing and much cheaper than higher quality chairs","This chair ticks a lot of boxes that I've had regarding a chair upgrade: Great price, good build and material, comfortable, and looks nice while not being overly gamer nor boring looking. I have a gripe, which is that the assembly is not a 15 minute process. I'm no expert with putting together chairs, tables, etc, however I have taken apart and put back together my PC dozens of times, so I'm no stranger to tinkering with screws, small pieces, and heavy objects. It took me around an hour and a half to fully construct the chair if we include me unpacking everything, and undoing a mistake I made where I mixed up the screws due to the diagram making them look similar in size. Seriously, the instructions make the screws easy to mix up with their similar looking sizes in the pictures. When you hold the screws in your hand, they do look different. Quite different. I believe that it would take 15 minutes for someone highly versed and experienced in building and taking apart furniture, chairs, dressers, etc. Someone that's been doing it for years.In terms of comfort and build, this is unbeatable for the price. Hands down. My old chair was of the mesh variety, and came from the same seller. While it wasn't falling apart, it was quite squeaky and after nearly 3 and a half years of use, I felt like I needed an upgrade. I'm glad I did. This chair oozes comfort. Going from crappy, foamy office chairs, to a decent mesh chair, and then to this is like going from 30fps to 60fps, and then going to 144fps. It's a change that you have to experience to understand. From the armrests, to the overall quality of the backrest, to the cushions supporting your head and lumbar (lower spine), this chair knocks it out of the park.The installation isn't a fast process for everyone. I can understand why these chairs don't come prebuilt, as the size of the box would be much bigger on top of using more cardboard. With that being said, I do hope for a future when installations are plug and play levels of easy. The last thing you want to be after spending a good chunk of money on a new, comfy chair is to be annoyed and thus uncomfortable. Still, I think this is a doable installation for most. I did it in a small room with not much space. I recommend a garage with some space around you, or a living room with some room.",5,NA

"66","GamingChair","Gaming Chair, Gaming Chairs for Adults with Footrest","Nirmal","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024","","A friend of mine has an $800 gaming chair which is really cool and super comfortable. This chair looked similar and was only $150 so I decided to give it a try. Is it as good as that $800 gaming chair? No. Definitely not. But it's still a comfortable chair that I like more than the chair I was using.I like the material. It's soft and feels good on my bare skin. I had to put armrest covers on my other chair because the hard plastic would irritate my forearms. No need for those on this chair. The seat, back, arms, and headrest are all covered with this material, whatever it is, and padded with a dense foam underneath. The lumbar pad offers nice back support and the headrest is quite comforting. I also like that the main support post is higher off the ground than any of my other office chairs by a couple inches.The back reclines and locks in place at whichever angle you desire, which is really cool. Unfortunately, it reclines too easily for me. There isn't enough resistance. I think that's my one major gripe, but even that's not too bad. I locked it in at a certain angle and have been okay with that. Still, I wish they would have made the resistance adjustable like all my other office chairs.So I guess I should get into some of the downsides, all of which are pretty minor. The armrest height is not adjustable. For me, that's fine as they're already at the perfect height. It comes with a leg rest thing which I found to be uncomfortable. The edge of it hits my legs at just the wrong place. I've never used one of these before and not even sure why I would want to. The lumbar pillow just sits on the seat, it doesn't connect in any way. In my friend's $800 chair this and the headrest both connect via magnets. The headrest on this attaches via elastic band.For $150 this is a very nice chair. It's no $800 chair but it looks nice and is comfortable on the butt, back, arms, and head.",5,NA

"69","GamingChair","Gaming Chair, Gaming Chairs for Adults with Footrest","Travis W","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024","","Ordered this chair to replace an aging Branch ergonomic chair. The product was received well packaged protecting good quality components. It took me about 30 minutes to assemble using the simple 1 page directions and included hex/Phillips combi tool.The color is a little darker than shown on the product page - more of a bluish slate color that should go well with most decors (see photo). Initial impressions are that the seat is pretty firm, which differs from the product description (""super soft and wide cushion""). I'm hoping it will soften with more use. The seat bottom and back are wide, easily accommodating my 6'1"" 240LB frame.The upholstery is described as a fabric having excellent breathability. It feels like PU leather to me rather than a fabric. I'm hoping the material is breathable when we get back into the warmer Southern California weather. It IS soft and comfortable, and is also used for the seat pillow, lumbar cushion and footrest.Speaking of the footrest, not sure what the function is. It slides directly out of the seat bottom. which is no where near my feet. Perhaps gamers might use it depending on how they sit in the chair but the position would be beyond my old dad body.Summarizing, the chair is sturdy and made from good quality materials. It is easy to assemble and feels solid when completed. It is roomy, and has adjustments for seat height and seat back recline. The seat bottom is firm when received. Combined with the testing noted in the product description I should get years of service.",5,NA

"78","GamingChair","GTRACING Gaming Chair with Footrest Speakers Video Game","Hyperion","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2022","","I purchased this to set up my new office. After combing through the vast selection of other chairs and all the reviews, I decided on this chair and I could not be happier.Before I launch into my assessment of the chair, I just want to say that you should absolutely buy it if you are thinking about purchasing this particular one. I have had many desk chairs of varying prices, sizes, features, etc. and this chair has thoroughly impressed me.Let's start with the assembly, which was so easy and straightforward. I saw some complaints about having a hard time with setting it up, but honestly, just use your brain and all will be ok. I am sure many could set this up without the instructions, which I did until I got to setting up the built-in speakers.I sit in this chair daily for hours and it is SO comfortable. Being able to adjust the back to several different angles is fantastic. The head and lumbar pillows are also great at giving some added support; they never feel like they're in the way. Reclining the chair to its furthest extent offers a very comfortable resting position, and, along with the added foot rest, it truly is a remarkably comfy ""recliner"" chair. The armrests are adjustable and offer some rotation so you can find the sweet spot for yourself.The built-in speakers are nifty too. **Disclaimer: You must buy the Bluetooth USB Receiver to utilize this feature.** I wasn't expecting much from them, but I do find myself switching to use them for certain entertainment purposes like listening to background music while I work or when I am playing specific games, in particular horror or racing games. The sound is way better than I anticipated, though they do lack bass. The relay unit lasts for hours (days usually for me) and charges quickly enough to never create frustration.Some other notes:-I saw a few complaints about the packaging and indentations created from remaining bundled up in the box. However, I did not experience this at all. All of the cushioned pieces came out of the box well packaged and without blemishes of any kind.-There was an odor initially when taking it out of the box. Ya know, that warehouse smell. After an hour or so, the smell had completely dissipated.-In regards to the Top Critical Review for this chair; That customer is absolutely insane and I cannot fathom what they were expecting for a chair in this price range. I used to have a fancy $980 chair provided from my employer, the largest social media entity. Comparatively, I am far happier with this chair. Yes, there are some plastic parts (dust covers, gas lift cover, armrests) but the expensive chair had the same plastic components. I feel less tension in my lower back after spending 6+ hours in this chair vs the expensive one where I would find myself getting up to walk around every so often to relieve the pain in my lower back. Oh, and they had mentioned missing parts due to the box being damaged (which has no bearing on the product itself); those particular items cannot be lost as they are attached to the chair and in a special pouch located on the back of the chair (see photo). They obviously didn't realize that.All-in-all, this is an excellent purchase for anyone who is looking at a new desk chair. The price is phenomenal for the quality and the amount of features. There is also a good amount of colors to choose from so you can better match your style and decor.",5,NA

Hats off to whoever put it together.The seat is surprisingly comfortable and sturdy, as the YT reviews suggested but much more comfortable than I would’ve expected.  I needed a more firm and supportive chair so don’t expect to sink in and be plushy.Every video BASHED the speaker quality comparing it to laptop equivalence. I had low expectations and thought it was more of a gimmick but these are actually louder and having more bass than what YT videos would have you think.  Don’t expect full Bose type quality but for the size of the speakers I would compare it to a smaller JBL flip. These speakers DO NOT distort at high volumes or deep bass (my music of choice is EDM)My only complaint is the foot rest, I wouldn’t pay the money for it.  I’m 5”10 with slightly longer legs than normal and the footrest is more of a calf rest.  My feet hang off and I wish it could come out a few more inches.  The foot rest is not that sturdy and has some give. It’s not well crafted and not really worth using by if you’re under 5’10 than this May suit you well.All in all, exceptional quality, easy to assemble and I would definitely look into this as a really good alternative to the Respawn 110",5,NA

The combination of ergonomic design, massage features, and adjustability make it suitable for long hours of use.

It’s an excellent choice for gamers and professionals alike who want to enhance their seating experience.",5,NA

The chair is very comfortable and nice. It is a bit heavy so definitely a 2 person job if youre on the smaller side. For what i paid it is a good chsir. Very sturdy. Some reviews say there was black stains on the chair…but one of those images was where u screw some of the parts together, so it wasnt a stain it was where you put it together. When i got my package some screws had like brown dust? I want to say rust, but the black paint was looking fine. So just keep an eye out for that. Mine didnt come with speakers",4,NA

"94","GamingChair","ECOTOUGE PC Gaming Chair","Skylar","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","","Okay, I have to rescind the review I had originally written for this product. I thought it was really cute and that the problem of feeling like I was going to fall out of it would fix itself at some point. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. So here are my problems with it:1. The aforementioned feeling like I'm going to fall out of it. The whole thing tilts forward, even when I'm leaning back, even after tightening the forward tilt knob as tight as it goes. I can't pull the footrest out and use it as support or I will literally flip over forwards. The back wheel is lifting up off the ground and I am definitely not heavy enough for it to do that unless the structural integrity of the chair is seriously damaged. I've tried everything, including putting things under the front wheels to balance it out, because I really want to like this chair... but no amount of changing my posture will do it. If I so much as breathe in this chair I have to sit way back to make sure I don't fall out of it.2. The seat is so uncomfortable. The tilted-up bits on the left and right might be nice if they were cushioned, but they are hard metal and so painful against my thighs. I can't sit in the same spot for more than two or three minutes or I start seriously hurting to the point I'm probably going to bruise. You can feel the hard metal underneath digging into your legs.3. There is no way to lock the arms, so if you so much as bump one of the arms, it makes a horrible, jarring click and digs into your side one way or the other. They're also majorly loose even though I followed the instructions exactly and tightened everything as tight as possible.4. The instructions themselves are a mess. All pictures. I put the footrest on completely wrong because it doesn't even have a picture for doing it and injured myself several times trying to get it on. Some parts don't look like they do in the manual and you have to make your best guess and sometimes do trial and error. The base was so difficult, too, the manual makes it look like you're supposed to slide it in and that is not the case. I injured myself here, too, thinking I was just doing it wrong when in fact it was the manual that was wrong and I had to figure out how to get it in myself.Just overall the chair is insanely uncomfortable, which is such a shame, because it's absolutely adorable. At this point I just want my money back. What a waste. I should've known it was too cute to be true.",5,NA
"95","GamingChair","ECOTOUGE PC Gaming Chair","Edward Williams","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024","","Seat is no where near as comfortable as it looks. The cushions don't feel very padded and the hard arm rests are a suck, my elbow is already irritated from resting my arm on it long enough to type this review. BUT it's pretty to look at and the neck pillow is nice. I'm a bit confused by the flap in the back. It velcros under the chair so maybe pillow storage but it's be difficult to velcro is with something behind the flap.Its a cheap chair for a cheap price.

"106","GamingChair","OneGame Gaming Chair","Mills","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","This is the best gaming chair","I've been remiss in leaving reviews for all the many things I've purchased from Amazon but this one has frustrated/displeased me enough to break that trend. I'm 220 lbs and 6'0"". I'm 66 yrs. old and have sat in hundreds of chairs like this one over the years. I've assembled them, used them for ages, and thrown them away after I've worn them out. If you're a short person you'll not have an issue with this chair. By short I mean no more than 5' probably. I set this chair to be at it's highest height as that's what is most comfortable for me. Unfortunately, as the day goes by it slowly sinks to the bottom height and I find my knees eventually crushing my chest. Now that's a slight exaggeration but you get the point.Yes, I know how to ""lock"" the mechanism. Every day, I use the handle to again lift the chair to its max height for the day's use, and then slowly but surely as time drags on it sinks to the bottom and becomes extremely uncomfortable and, essentially, unusable.I'd return it but the excessive difficulty putting it together, even with two people, makes the thought of disassembling it horrendous. And then to load it into a vehicle and actually wait in line somewhere to drop it off for return makes the process impossible.When it's at its best and standing tall this chair is extremely good, but give it an hour or so and it begins to become what, to me, is a very vociferous ""DO NOT BUY"" recommendation.One other minor irritation but a consistent one nonetheless are the arms. There is a rather large gap between the back of the arm and the back of the chair. If you wear shortsleeve shirts, and that's mandatory for me here in Florida, when you go to stand up your sleeve has a frequent tendency to get caught on the end of the arm causing some humorous gesticulations. A design flaw for me personally but probably won't be much of an issue for others.",5,NA

"109","GamingChair","OneGame Gaming Chair","Qiyong Zhang","Reviewed in Canada on June 23, 2024","So comfy","I've tested 3 Ergonomic Office Chairs, 5 Gaming Chairs and to be honest, this one is the best for under $300. I tested out a Stples chair of the same quality at $470.00 with taxes and I'm glad I bought this one.No, I am not getting paid to say this. I love this chair and I see a few negative reviews here, so I'd love to share my thoughts.PROS:- the lumbar support and pillow are great. It's not too hard, not too soft.- pillows are adjustable. If you really don't like them, 1. Remove them and 2. Buy a memory foam velcro pillow that clips on, for a car. It's the same thing and twice as comfortable, for only $30-50 each. Smart savings.- the construction feels great and the material is virtually the same of other gaming chairs rated at $400-600 range. If you want a perfect gaming chair, be prepared to spend $700-900. It may be a lot, sure, but think of how long you're gonna own a chair, and think of the back pain it'll save you from. I had a small blue chair with no support from age 13-28, so it's time to upgrade.- If your chair breaks in some way, there is limited warranty from the supplier and amazon. But keep in mind, a chair for only $150.00, is a risk you take. That's super cheap for what you get.- the chair reclines almost at a full 180 degrees (approximately 170), allowing you to lay flat. I love it.- armests are adjustable, up and down only, not side to side or left to right.- I have sat in the chair for 6 hours, doing homework and gaming and I love it. I am 6' 0"" at 185lbs. The chair is good for me but if you are over 215lbs, you may want a slightly wider chair.CONS:- armests are only 2D, not 4D. This is expected for the price.- no footrest, but that doesn't matter. I've tried the footrests for a lot of these chairs and they suck. 1. They're not long enough, so your feet hang, as the footrest ends, 6"" before your heel, 2. They're not well made. 3. What I did instead was buy a $130.00 ottoman with storage, non-foldable, on Amazon, and it's a perfect footrest which I can move around freely. I use the storage for my gaming controllers and the ottoman fits perfectly under my desk if I want more space. In case I can't post a link in a review, here's the product info. Name: ""Tufted Leather Square Flip Top Storage Ottoman Cube Foot Rest, Black"" sold by ""H&B Luxuries"" on Amazon.- a review I saw ""oh the plastic piece of the side broke."" Not sure how, as this is fastened via 1 screw. If your screw hole is too big, add 1 small washer and this will fix the problem. Mine was fine. 1. Test out any product you get and 2. If there are any issues, it's your job to return them and get a new one or a refund. Accidents do happen in manufacturing, but instead, I see people complain, and write a bad review LOL. That's your fault brother.- it'd be nice if this chair came in more colours, but I love the black as it blends with everything. White & black usually do. I got an all black chair myself.",5,NA

Parts are not marked, including the screws, so no help there.  It's figureoutable, though.While this may be rated for 300#, nobody that weighed that much would fit in this.  It's probably wide enough, just barely, but it's very shallow.  It only comes to my upper thigh, I can't imagine being able to be comfortable if I had more junk in my trunk.The chair tilts well but the lumbar support can't be removed so, when tilting, it's quite uncomfortable.  That renders the tilt somewhat useless.The lumbar section does feel good, though.I think it's also lower than most office chairs.  I really should have measured all that.  I'll grab it from the hubs tomorrow and add it in after this posts.The seat cushion isn't bad.  Decently thick, medium-firm.Casters are light duty and roll about as well as any caster.",3,NA
