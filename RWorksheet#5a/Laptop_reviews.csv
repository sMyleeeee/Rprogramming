Whether I’m binge-watching shows or tackling work tasks, this tablet handles it all effortlessly.The overall performance is smooth, with plenty of storage for apps and media.

"2","Laptop","Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11” display","DoomOfSarnath","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","","Well, for $190-$230 this tablet might not be the best at one particular thing, but thanks to some common-sense decisions and Amazon's resources and commitment, it's competent enough at everything, all at once.Media consumption, retro games, word processing, digital art, battery life, you name it.For media consumers, it has an obscenely long battery life and a pretty nice screen. Contrast is surprisingly good for an IPS display (the black areas look black), colors are very poppy, and the 5:3 aspect ratio means you're not losing much space on either 16:9 or 4:3 content.For retro games, let's talk about the processor. It has a Mali G57 MC2, 2 Cortex A78 cores, and 6 Cortex A55 cores. Anyone who keeps up with Android hardware will know this is a bizarre setup. The Mali G57 MC2 and Cortex A55s are all modest, cheap, power-sipping technology. While the Cortex A78s are freakishly fast for this price point.But I'm certain Amazon did this on purpose, and it's responsible for the great battery life, which is essential for what is basically a media consumption tablet. The modest GPU and high number of ""little"" cores keep battery drain minimal (this is a 5w chip, in a tablet, where 7-10w chips are the norm) while 2 A78s give it some serious oomph for the right sorts of tasks.This accidentally makes this little tablet a retro gaming powerhouse, as that relies heavily on single-core performance, with the GPU and secondary cores being an afterthought.So, it's a tablet that just excels at anything where you'll be using the screen a lot. Reading, movies, old games, etc. It may struggle with native Android games due to the weaker GPU, but compared to retro games there aren't a lot of worthwhile Android games anyway IMO.The keyboard and stylus are also very well executed.I'm typing this review on the keyboard case, and the keys are a nice size thanks to the TKL form factor, with short travel and a nice tactile, springy feel. The trackpad is small, but accurate and doesn't ""lose"" my finger.The stylus itself uses a user-replaceable AAAA battery. I like this decision, because small Li-po batteries wear out fast, and the AAAA means that the stylus has a super long life without worrying about whether you'll be able to find a replacement in a few years. The stylus is also magnetic and clips to the side of the tablet.The stylus is pretty accurate. I don't notice much parallax or judder. My Galaxy Tab S8 actually had slightly more parallax. However, there is more input lag than you'll get with something like a Galaxy Tab S8 or iPad with Apple Pencil. It's a quite noticeable amount of input lag compared to those two. I will mention, this tablet is about 1/3 the price of those devices and actually has a longer battery life. So it's still better than you expect for the price. But will definitely be more of an ""entry level"" art tablet instead of something outstanding.All in all, I still think you're getting a lot more for your money with this tablet than the others available. Amazon's reach with e-readers, with keyboards, with stylus peripherals, with tablets, and their resources and supply chain (ie, being able to order unusual tablet SoCs) has definitely given the Kindle Fire 11 a wider spread of abilities and better quality than your ordinary budget tablet. I can't really name anything I'd expect to be better for the price.The only real flaw is software; since Google Play is not preloaded and Amazon is not putting a lot of effort into their own App store, be prepared to sideload some apps if you want to use the broader spectrum of abilities this tablet has.",5,NA
"3","Laptop","Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11” display","The Bearded Mystic","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023","""Versatile and Powerful Tablet!""","This is by far the best Fire Tablet since the HDX series, and my favorite.  To put into context my love of the Fire Tablet, I’ve owned (or bought and returned) the following over the past 11 years:Fire 7 (2012/2014/2020),Fire HDX 7 (2014),Fire HD 8 (2018),Fire HD 8+ (2020/2022),Fire HD 10 (2018, 2019),Fire HD 10+ (2021),Fire Max 11 (2023).Of those, the ones I kept or kept the longest was the Fire HDX 7, the Fire 7 (2014), and the Fire HD 10 (2018).Specs for the Fire Max 11 can be found within the product description.Design and BuildThe Max 11 boasts a sleek and modern design, coupled with a build quality that feels robust and premium. Its lightweight aluminum structure makes it convenient for both work and leisure, allowing easy handling and portability. I like that it went back to a similar size/ratio of the 2018 HD 10.PerformanceEquipped with a more powerful processor than its predecessor, the Max 11 is capable of handling various tasks smoothly. Whether I am browsing the web, watching videos, or using multiple apps simultaneously, the experience is fluid and lag-free, especially compared to my HD 10.While not ‘blazingly fast’, it IS much faster than I expected.  Out of curiousity, I wound up trying it with a bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo, and for the first time-I feel this is a possible viable laptop replacement for light to medium users.  My HD 10 does not make a viable laptop replacement.  Great multitasking ability, can run enough apps at once with little to no lag.The speakers are merely adequate, if not a tad disappointing.  Thought normally I either use ear buds or a bluetooth speaker.  I don't miss having a head phone jack, and love having the quite responsive finger print sensor on the power button.DisplayThis has been probably my biggest surprise.  The display is vibrant and crisp, offering excellent viewing angles. It renders colors accurately, making it a joy to use for both media consumption and reading.  I do wish it was a TAD brighter at times, but the vibrancy of the colors makes up for it most of the time.  I’d wondered how much of a viewing difference going from the 10 to the 11 would be, and it’s shockingly a pretty big difference.  The Max 11 almost feels like a small tv, or laptop screen at times.Battery LifeBattery life has been good.  It’s not the best nor the worst, and should be more than adequate for most users.  Since I have chargers adjacent to most places I use the tablet in my house, I’ve also not needed to run it low.ValueOne of the reasons I’ve had so many Fire tablets (I’ve owned only one other non Fire tablet, a 6th gen iPad mini that I use for my business) is that I love the value proposition and ease of use.  Reviewers like to talk down the Fire software, but I have never minded it.  I am admittedly deep into the Amazon ecosystem with movies, books, music, etc., so the operating system has always made it easy to access and use that stuff.  I have also side loaded the Play store (I did this on my HD 10 also), so I have access to almost the entire Play store of apps on my Max 11.  If one is really ambitious, you can essentially turn it into more an Android operating system.  Personally, I have never like the tablet OS offered from iPad or Android tablets.  When the Fire Max 11 was first announced, I was excited about the specs, but hesitant on the price.  So I waited until Prime Day to buy it, also taking advantage of the trade in offer.  In terms of what I paid ($229-$30 trade in gift card-$46 trade in 25% off-$80 prime day offer=$73.99), of course it’s an awesome value.  At $229…I would suggest either going refurbished if available or just waiting it out for the inevitable discounts (at the time I write this, it’s on sale for $189.99).  But I still think it’s a great tablet at $229, and wouldn’t fault anyone that pays that.OverallIn conclusion, the Fire Max 11 strikes a balance between aesthetics and functionality, offering a modern solution that should meet the needs of most while offering value and longevity. It might be a worthy addition to your tech arsenal, promising reliability and efficiency in daily use.Rating: 4.5/5",5,NA

"5","Laptop","Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 tablet","Kindle Customer","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024","","It worked, looked and felt brand new. Couldn't even tell that it was refurbished. It's very easy to use I've owned a few smaller Kindles and I bought a large one like this a year ago and I took it with me on a trip to my mom's house and showed it to her she had a easy time learning how to use it and play games on it so I ended up letting her keep it. I got this one to replace mine and I love it. Very easy to use to stream Netflix, Disney plus etc on, has a good selection of games on the app store with most being free or cheap but the main reason I bought it is to read books on and comics from comicology. I would highly recommend",5,NA

I’m a solo musician and a side man for others including some large concerts. I researched some programs and tablets that would suit my needs. I find this 10” tablet to be just the ticket. I read a few complaints that it was slow. I find it plenty fast, easy to transfer files from a PC, the sound is pretty good using Bluetooth but better hard wired, no gaps or drop outs in the sound. It’s big enough to read set lists and lyrics at five or six feet. I have also used it for sheet music on occasion with success. All in all a great product and a bargain.",5,NA
"7","Laptop","Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 tablet","Sunshine","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2024","","I purchased the Amazon HD 10 tablet last year. The first one was not functioning properly so I was able to return it and receive a second one from that point up until now the beginning of 2024 the experience has been subpar. Though I have an SD card for additional storage the ram just isn't there and once you start trying to maneuver your apps it starts to slow down tremendously. I did a factory reset at one point and reinstalled specific items and yet the screen would turn on and off, would not basically listen to commands?I called Amazon and told him what the problem was and that I have been an Amazon customer for many many years as most of you probably are, they were not willing to accept the return I do understand however I keep my items and pristine condition so they allowed for a replacement. I mailed back my tablet and it's original box and all content, they sent me a refurbished one which I was a little concerned about. Upon startup I realized that I'm completely ad free which is great! And it seems to me running very smooth so I have to say that the refurbished item seems to be working better than the initial two new ones.This won't be used for anything heavy like gaming, doing a lot of video content, never was intended for that use but it is now a secondary tablet which allows a family member to utilize on their own.I would recommend the Amazon tablets if you want something entry and you're not concerned about running out of storage you can put your own MicroSD in there and I think that it's a good value for the money.Update: 4.8.24I've been using this tablet since I received the refurbished one from amazon. And today this is only going to be a secondary used tablet for the primary reason of its slow running ability! It takes forever to load an app that is pre-installed and if you're wanting to get battery life out of this I would say it's average sometimes below average. I have owned Amazon products for many years but I feel as though they are still not in line with other tablets that are more mainstream. So, I would not engage and purchasing any further Amazon tablets because I just feel that the memory, ram, general build quality is just subpar at best.",4,NA

Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.  Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.",4,NA

That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.",5,NA
"26","Laptop","Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH Slim Laptop","David Fisher","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","","Pretty good laptop. Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k.",5,NA

The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows.",5,NA

Blair","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2023","","I got the 15 inch, i needed this mostly for a good laptop, long battery life, USB C Charging, and price. I looked at several ""higher"" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only ""missing"" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true ""lap"" top.Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE.",5,NA

I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a ""bling"" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running.",4,NA

Unfortunately, this one is for the latter.  I purchased this device to begin with as a laptop to be used by my son for Chicago public schools and allow him to be able to access his school work. Upon receiving the first unit physically, the device looks and feels wonderful and within 2 days of starting to use it. The screen was no longer capable for touch capabilities and the keyboard was non-functional as well.  I called their customer support line at Asus and Asus. Couldn't figure out what was wrong either, but I was supposed to pay to send a device I just bought to go have it repaired by Asus and this is why I say their customer service is knowledge below standard but I would say some of the worst there is on the market today.  Amazon luckily was able to step in and send me a new unit as a replacement.  Amazon's customer service is some of the best I've ever you dealt with.  Got the new unit and now this one over here. Can't even stay connected to Wi-Fi. My kid can't do his homework.  This computer is a total piece of garbage even for something as simple as a means to do homework for a grade school.

"54","Laptop","Amazon Fire 7 tablet (newest model) 7","Pamela R. Merritt","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023","","I needed an e-reader which could handle my needs, and that's why I rated my Fire 7 highly. I'm not using it to play games or stream movies or take pictures and videos. Though I got the no ads/32 gig model, because reading is serious business.Because it was my six year old Kindle Paperwhite that got me into this. I love reading on it, even library books. This is important, because I'm a writer (The Way of Cats book) and a devoted reader. To keep up with this favorite hobby, I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Still, there are many books, and I also subscribe to Scribd. I have books I own, and books I rent, essentially.Which makes my Paperwhite less of a general reader than I would like. I'm also researching a new book. I can send all these PDFs to my Kindle account, but it's not the same reading or highlighting experience as an optimized PDF reader. In my mind, I'd like to keep these documents, but not on my Bookshelf, mixed with the thrillers and the sciences.Recent thoughts of how long my Paperwhite would last led me to consider e-readers in general. Reading outdoors is combining two of my favorite things, where a dedicated e-ink device really shines, so some kind of Kindle reader is important to me. But I could really use a general purpose reader. This was my first attempt at combining these needs. I am very pleased.The Silk browser, included, let me navigate to the address of the Scribd app (information on the Scribd site.) This let me download a third party app, permission for which I first adjusted in settings. Currently testing PDF readers in the Amazon App Store, for some free books I got in that format.Now I have three readers in one. My Kindle and Scribd books update on my other apps, and I them as I've always done. This screen is as easy to read on as my iPad mini, so no complaints. My iPad is bigger and heavier, with the case and the Pencil, and not something I put in my purse if I don't need to. The Fire 7 works better for what I usually need a purse device for, which is reading and web browsing. My phone is really old and won't keep downloaded books for very long. The idea being that if I'm stuck somewhere with no wifi, I have books in the device. And they will be there.The Kindle app is almost fully operational, but I can't put books into Collections with it, and the layout is subtly different, but it works fine. If it gets confused, I restart it. It's not a high tech device, but it's great for the price.",5,NA
"55","Laptop","Amazon Fire 7 tablet (newest model) 7","Pamela R. Merritt","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2023","","So I only just got this and thought I'd share my initial review and hopefully answer questions that others might have that has been difficult to find answers for.Size differencesAs most have already seen, this version is different from the previous in shape and size, yes it is slightly smaller. For most users who had the previous version, the kicker is that your covers and cases etc. are no longer compatible.Also the Charger uses USB-C plug also which is different from the previous versions.In terms of performanceThis is night and day in comparison to the older versions.  The older version was slick when it first came out but like most people know, the FireOS is basically Android and as more and more updates have been applied, the older version is now running really slow. So basically this new version hardware was tailored for the today's version of android thus it runs very fast and very slick, this is a very crucial issue.NO YOUTUBE KIDS APPThe biggest issue anyone will encounter and is well known about is that this does not have the Google Play Store or accompanying services. That means that IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NATIVE YOUTUBE KIDS APP.There are many people on here that simply either don't understand what a native app is or simply confuse it with the main Youtube. I myself had multiple answers that failed to answer this basic question with multiple contradictory answers or reviews that failed to  understand the question.Amazon FIRE tablets DO NOT HAVE YOUTUBE KIDS Apps. Amazon has their own Youtube.com app which it seems they created as the developer email address for that app is an amazon.com email address. When you click YOUTUBE KIDS link in that app it jumps to the browser and opens in the browser which is a terrible experience. It is strange given that on the fire TV, the YouTube app allows you to switch to kids profiles, if only Amazon would do that for their tablet youtube app. But until then What you have are 3rd party apps built by you know who on the AppStore that plays youtube. They are not native apps, nor do they support most of the functionality as is. They are not written by Youtube, Google or Amazon either, so if you want to give those apps your google login which is used for Youtube Kids then you do so at your own risk.YES YOU CAN INSTALL YOUTUBE KIDS NATIVE APP, BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF.I don't know why nor will I try to even get into this very very old topic of not having youtube kids, but the GOOD news is that it is very simple and easy to get Youtube kids native apps on this 12th gen version. You don't need to be a modder or anything intense. But a simple web search will tell you how to do this. Just know that you will have to install 4 different google apps/services first to get the Play Store. This is even easier as you simply open the browser, download each of them from the website and Click to install. DONE AND DUSTED.  Once you have the Play Store you can easily install any of the native youtube Kids apps or even the original Youtube app from google and even login to your tablet with your gmail account. I was able to do this in 30 minutes.With YouTube Kids installed. I am now able to give this 10 Stars.This is basically very decent hardware and latest OS for $60.You cannot go wrong with this as a kids tablet especially with the ability from Amazon to quickly lock this down.Touch Screen is extremely responsiveI have struggled to find a decent priced kids tablet that is responsive enough to use the ANTON app without lag. This is the fastest tablet I have seen at this price point. For those that haven't used ANTON, it is by far the best app for teaching your kids. It has school derived lessons, I would recommend every parent should download ANTON. But it's writing lessons, needs a screen that is responsive and a fairly decent tablet. This tablet passes the ANTON test with a gold star.Sound is clear with some bass. It doesn't sound like a tin can.Sound quality is very loud and clear. Trust me, if you've been through the dozen kids tablets I have, you will be surprised how much of a let down it would be when you have poor sound. Kids need to hear clearly and this does it without issues.The Amazon AppStore itself is actually pretty good. All the apps we had on our old android tablet were available except for Youtube Kids. I'd imagine there are many more that are not available but most of the decent kids ones are on there including ANTON, ABC Kids etcI would think that since the FireTV Youtube app allows kids profiles, that Amazon would at some point do the same with their own tablet Youtube app.As it is right now this table is almost perfect especially once I was able to manually install play store and youtube kids easily. I'm ordering a second one.",5,NA
