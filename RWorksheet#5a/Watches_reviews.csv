Took a while to figure out the day, i.e., Friday, Saturday...  Can't seem to change the date, which is off by one day.  Still testing.  UPDATE:  In less than six months the watch died.  I went to change the battery and it went downhill from there. Once I pulled the plastic from the battery to change it nothing worked.  I had purchased a fresh pack of 2025 so I know it wasn't the new battery.",5,NA

It has all the usual features (stop watch, alarm, date) and it is easy to read as well as comfortable to wear. Do be aware that the watch is huge and bulky, you are not gonna win any fashion contests with this.The cons of this watch are fairly small and simple but they are significant enough to make it lose 2 stars from my rating. The first and most important issue is the manual. I tried searching for it online and it is impossible to find, if you lose it you are SOL so I have taken the trouble of taking pictures of it and putting them in this review in case some helpless soul comes to this page looking for the manual.The second issue is that the watch has this thing on its display (marked with red in the last picture) that seems to be tied to the seconds but I have no idea what it does. The manual doesn't even acknowledge its existence and frankly it takes a significant portion of the display real state.Other than it is a really good watch. The light is bright, the strap is comfy, it looks like something the Navy SEALS would wear while raiding Bin Laden. I'd recommend it.Edit: Amazon scrambled all of the pictures and messed up the order. Amazing work Amazon.",1,NA

It’s easy to use, and the touch screen is smooth and responsive. The fitness tracking features are accurate and helpful for tracking my steps, heart rate, and workouts. The battery lasts a long time, so I don’t have to charge it every day. I love how it looks sleek and stylish, matching any outfit.

The 1.96"" HD display is crystal clear and easy to navigate, making it a delight to use. The fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, accurately monitoring my heart rate, sleep patterns, and various sports activities. I love how it reminds me to move when I've been sitting for too long and tracks my steps throughout the day. The fact that it is IP68 waterproof is a huge bonus, as I can wear it even during my swimming sessions. The ability to answer and make calls directly from the watch is incredibly convenient, and the call quality is surprisingly good. Overall, this smartwatch has exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and feature-rich wearable device.",5,NA
"18","watch","Smart Watch for Women Answer/Make Calls, 1.9 HD Fitness Watch with Heart Rate Monitor Sleep Monitor","Winston L","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024","Excellent!!","We've had quite a few different watches come through our house including Fitbits, Apple watches, and some lesser known fitness watches.This is a wider style watch and it somewhat resembles an Apple Watch.  At a much lower price, the build as expected is much lighter.Pros:Battery life is extremely long.  I'm used to an Apple Watch that can make it through the day, but needs daily charging.  This watch after wearing for a full day is still at 4 bars.The advantage of having a long battery life is that one can reliably use it for sleep monitoring.  I couldn't do that with the Apple Watch since it would always need charging overnight.Very large, bright and clear display - It can show time, date, temperature, heart rate, steps, calories, and mileage all on the main screen.Band is comfortable with 16 notches to adjust (compared to 7 on an Apple watch band).Straight forward set-up through an app on the phone (Glory Fit).Fitness tracking is similar to the Apple Watch.  I wore two watches for a day (this one and the Apple Watch) just to see how they differed.  Very close in overall steps and heart rate.Has a few simple non-fitness capabilities - messages display, stopwatch, calculator, control music on the phoneCons:Limited capabilities beyond that of fitness functionsOverall, if you're looking for a watch for mainly timekeeping, fitness, and sleep capabilities, this is a really solid value.",5,NA

"21","watch","Smart Watch for Women Answer/Make Calls, 1.9 HD Fitness Watch with Heart Rate Monitor Sleep Monitor","Karen D'Agostino","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024","Exceptional Smart Watch - A Great Investment for Health and Fitness Enthusiasts!","This watch promises more than it delivers.  It purports to measure your pulse, but I find it seriously inaccurate.  The values are all over the place, from 50 BPM to over 130 BPM.  There is no way I could have been at 130 BPM without my knowing it - I'd have been gasping for breath.  I doubt my pulse ever gets down to 50 BPM, either.  I'm just not that laid back.The manufacturer says that for greater accuracy you need to wear the watch more tightly om your wrist.  When I tried that I found that my skin couldn't breathe, which caused it to become irritated.  So the values are just going to be inaccurate.It doesn't seem to know when I go to sleep, either.  Often before I turn in, I read for a bit.  At such times I am immobile, so the watch thinks I'm sleeping.  If I have to get up to pee in the night, the watch thinks I've gotten up for 20-40 minutes or so.It purports to measure blood oxygen saturation levels, which for all I know it might be doing.  I have never found any use for that particular function.It annoyingly is connected to my phone such that when I get a call, my watch starts making a lot of noise.  I have not yet found the way to stop this.  The instructions are inadequate.  This is highly annoying, because almost every call is spam.One feature that seems to work well is its keeping track of my steps.  That's useful, and is a reminder to me to keep walking.  Once upon a time I had a pedometer that I used.  That's all it did - measure my steps.  I wanted that.  So if this watch did nothing more, I would still like it as a pedometer.Overall I am disappointed in this watch.  I probably wouldn't buy it again.  I might recommend it to someone I didn't like.",5,NA

"26","watch","Smart Watch for Women Answer/Make Calls, 1.9 HD Fitness Watch with Heart Rate Monitor Sleep Monitor","Mirko","Reviewed in Italy on November 15, 2024","","This watch is amazing! I wanted a watch that could monitor my heart beat. I had previously purchased a very expensive watch for around £150 but it wouldn't pick up my heart beat so I returned it. I saw this watch on offer for £23 so thought I would try it as it had some fantastic reviews. Within about 5 seconds of wearing it, it picked up my heart beat and appears to accurately monitor it throughout the day. You can set the watch to check for a low or high heart beat too, and it will buzz if either of these are reached. It also does my blood oxygen. I have been on a bit of an exercise mission so I wear my watch on my daily walks, and it accurately tracks my steps. I have connected it to the app on my phone (which is used to set up the watch and record information - which was really easy to do) so I can use my watch to read any text messages I receive as well as messages through other apps. The main watch face displays the time, date, weather, how much charge is left, number of steps, number of calories burnt, heart beat, and number of km travelled. You can also make and receive calls from the watch. You can set a workout such as cycling, walking, running etc. It can also track your sleep (which I haven't tried as I don't like sleeping with a watch on). You can use it as an audio device to play music. It has an alarm clock on it, stopwatch, timer, torch, a sytem to find your phone, a remote camera and calculator. It holds its charge really well. I am currently on day 3 after charging it and it is registering as 63% charged. I 100% recommend this watch to anyone. I'm sure there are watches out there that do far more, but it already has more functions than I will actually use, so I am more than happy with it. I also find it really easy to use and navigate.",5,NA

I just love the fact that they list stop by stop where your order is. I ordered this for my son for his graduation present and was very excited to give it to him. I was able to see how many stops the driver had before he got to me which allowed me to not only have a better idea of its arrival time, but I was also able to enjoy a buildup of excitement as it got closer and closer.As for the quality of the product ~ both my son and I are very impressed and more than satisfied with the watch so far. I was very trepidatious as so many items, especially jewelry items, look stunning, gorgeous, beautiful, high quality in the pictures online and are nothing short of utterly disappointing when you get them. This watch renewed my belief that there are honest sellers out there. I will say that we just got the watch today so this is purely about the initial presentation and look of the watch.So, the packaging was super nice, high-end quality. Each piece (bands, watchface) were separately wrapped in nice, thick plastic to protect from scratching. The boxes (box for watch & slip cover outer box) were great quality (you know, so many companie's packaging falls apart at barely a touch, which makes me wonder about the quality of what's inside). Thorough, grammatically correct (mostly) directions included; also had tools for taking out links along with fairly easy to follow pictured & written directions. We did have to use a separate pin with a head (like tailors use to mark hem points) to push out the pins bcz the one included bent.One thing I really appreciate is that the company said they are there anytime and to please let them know of any issues. Usually companies do all they can to make it as hard as possible to be contacted.I couldn't stop looking at the watch! It DEFINITELY looks SO MUCH MORE expensive than it was! And the workings move like a Rolex (smoothly), not jumpy like the workings of normal watches. Even my husband remarked on how ""Rolexey"" it looked. I ordered the all black watch.Again, we've only just gotten it, but if the initial presentation is any indicator of its performance, WE'VE GOT A WINNER!!",5,NA

I set it then tried some of its features.  The stopwatch worked but it did not reset to the zero position properly.  The 24 hour time indicator was off by one hour.  The rotating bezel had black lacquer on it that was tender to the touch.  A fingernail could have damaged it and a very small nick had already started out of the box.

That being said, I am pretty satisfied with it. It was super easy to set up and connect to my phone. So far it hasn't disconnected for any reason. Its pretty comfortable (I haven't worn a watch in years), easy to read the screen. It looks good, doesn't seem to big or anything like that. I like that I can set drink water reminders. It seems accurate in the health tracking as far as I can tell. I did notice the step counting does/can get a little wonky if you're shaking your arm alot. I was sitting in bed while fixing my sheets and blankets and it gave me about 50 steps, but I don't think it's that bad seeing as I personally don't typically just shake my arms.

I did read reviews and saw that there were some issues, but didn't see anything related to this but maybe I missed it. Anyhow, the watch is as described. It does sync up with your phone easily. However it just won't connect to Alexa, I keep getting a java error. I've taken two calls through it, while the phone calls worked perfectly- I think the placement of the speaker affects the quality. Ie; can't hear sometimes while I'm moving because the speaker moves too close to my wrist and gets muffled. As this was my first foray into smartwatch territory, I don't know if this is typical placement for wrist speaker or not. The step counter seemed to be reasonably accurate, but the calorie counter was way out in left field it was so wrong.

First, the step tracker is completely inaccurate (which is the reason I bought this in the first place). It randomly deducted 1000 steps regularly and there was no way to fix this. Second, the charger is horribly designed. It’s almost always loose which means the watch isn’t charging. Third, the watch randomly stopped working in the middle of my workout. It was fully charged btw. I was lifting so it’s not like I was in water or excessively sweating like in cardio. I tried doing a hard reset and charging it but nothing worked. That was the last straw for me.I bought this mainly to track my steps and workouts but it was not effective. I would not recommend.

Big numbers. Looks like a G-Shock. If you want a watch to tell time, provide an alarm and use as a timer/stopwatch that’s easy to see, buy it. The light works fine. I have the grey with the negative display, and it’s easy to read too. Also have the tan. I wish the black and tan were available in negative display but they still look good the way they come. Great watch..great price..great battery life. Pick a color and buy it.",5,NA
"56","watch","Casio Illuminator AE1500WH Series","Dru Ha","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","","I have used my cell phone instead of a watch since about 2001.  Decided to start wearing cheap, quartz watches again because I often find myself without my cell phone within reach at rehearsals, recording sessions, lawn-mowing, or work from home situations. Picked up a few Timexes and Casios around the same time. So far, I like this model the best for general use. The size of the time display is so easy to read that I have already started preferring it to comparable analog models.  I will mostly be looking to buy digital watches like this with big, simple displays from now on.I’m not James Bond, in spite of what you may have heard. I don’t want an expensive watch on my wrist that might make me a potential target for theft/robbery downtown or on a subway. If I get some paint on this one or it breaks while I’m trying to remove an oil filter, it would be no great loss.Use is fairly intuitive and it hasn’t lost or gained time in the few weeks I’ve owned it, unlike a Timex expedition analog model I got at the same time. After only a couple of weeks, the analog Timex expedition has lost about ten seconds already, which I admit I was surprised by.The only complaint I could possibly make about this watch is that the two LED’s are quite poor in comparison to Timex’s indiglo or the backlight used on much more expensive G-Shock models. But for how cheap and functional this model is, that is a completely unfair comparison. The lights work perfectly fine for me to see if I wake up in the middle of the night but can’t roll/reach over to check my phone due to a sleeping dog contorting my legs at the foot of the bed. Or if I fall asleep on the couch.I have mostly avoided getting it wet up until now, but I did accidentally leave it in the bathroom with the shower running a couple of times and no condensation formed on the inside of the face at all even though there was plenty of water vapor in the room. I also leave it on when washing my hands with no ill-effects.I’m very impressed by how simple and functional this watch is. These cheap, digitals are light years ahead of the Timex Ironman I owned as a kid. But it should be said- that $25-$35 Ironman I bought sometime around 1995 went body boarding, surfing, in the pool with me, and I showered with it on. That thing was basically water-PROOF and never had an issue in water less than 20ft. deep. I swam in Atlantic/East-Coast hurricanes with that thing and it even got tossed around in the salty surf with me. Also used it to time lap-swimming in Olympic-sized pools. I do not have the same confidence in this model, though I have no real rationale for that.The rubber strap was very uncomfortable on the old Ironman models and used to cause some really annoying, visible, skin irritation. I found G-shock straps of that era to be almost just as bad. That is not the case with these modern Casio polymer straps.I also despise those weird circles Casio, Armitron, etc. put on watch faces and take up a quarter of the face of the watch. This watch has NONE of that BS going on. The info on the watch face is SO bold and easy to read that I would definitely prefer it to all the G-shocks with those damned, senseless circles taking up so much of the display. PV cells excluded because they actually do serve a purpose. But here’s my view on all that: if the watch battery lasts even close to ten years, it will already outlast the battery/operation of the solar-powered, $150 G-Shock I once owned by a factor of YEARS. So I would still prefer this because legibility is far more important to me than photovoltaics.After a few weeks getting used to wearing a watch again for the first time in twenty years, I’ve really appreciated not having to dig my cell phone out of my pocket just to check the time/date. A weirdly subtle difference I would never have thought would matter.  But it does. I’m starting to really like Casios!I also like the hourly chime because otherwise I get lost and completely lose track of time while recording/producing. That could only backfire if the chime goes off in the vocal booth and ruins a take. Hasn’t happened yet, though.I’m also glad they make it in the desert-sand/beige color because I’m fair skinned so it doesn’t look like a giant thing on my wrist.At some point or other I will wake up exhausted and forget to take it off before I get in the shower. At that point I will update this review if water penetrates the buttons/gaskets/seals.Again, I am in disbelief at how excellent this watch is for the price. I hope they never discontinue this model until an identical “20 Year Battery” model is available.  But by then we’ll no doubt have flying cars, rocket-skates, jet packs, and digital, tattooed watches with veinous, indiglo epidermis.  Or more than the current, standard-issue, two to three computer chips implanted into in our visual cortex at birth.Just pick the color you like and buy the damned thing!",5,NA

I have an Apple Watch and another stainless steel “dress” watch.I wanted a watch I could wear when working out, or doing something physical that wasn’t going to buzz at me every 8 seconds and tell me what a good boy I was for taking 5 steps and remind me to breathe.Also, I think Apple Watches are great, but they’re a little bloated with useless features that, at the end of the day, I’ve never really used.I wanted something simple, easy to read, and able to take a beating. I wanted basic tactical features (like dual time zones, stop watch, alarms, timer, a clear second display, a light)This watch is easily comparable to the “G-Shock”.Not only does it do everything I want it to do, it looks incredible. It’s very stylish. Very clear, easy to read display at a glance and it fits great (I’m a guy, 5’7” with a small wrist circumference and got the “standard” size)I’ve tested the display light in the dark and it works great. Easily readable.Build quality seems excellent. Seems to be sturdy and durable. Doesn’t feel or look cheap by any means.Haven’t tested the water resistance yet but I don’t doubt it’s going to be fine.And finally, the price. The price is unbelievable for what you get. For the $20-25 price point you get way more features and value than you’d expect.Highly recommend!",5,NA

From its classic design to its impressive functionality, this watch is truly a standout piece.The first thing that caught my eye was the stunning dial, which adds a unique and stylish touch to the traditional Grant design. It’s the perfect balance of elegance and modernity, making it suitable for any occasion.The chronograph display not only adds a practical element to the watch but also gives it a sporty edge that my significant other loves. Whether he’s timing laps at the track or simply keeping track of the time during a busy day, the chronograph feature comes in handy.The quality of the watch is evident in every detail, from the durable stainless steel case to the comfortable blue leather strap. It feels substantial on the wrist without being too heavy, and the craftsmanship is top-notch.But perhaps the best part of all is seeing the smile on my significant other’s face whenever he wears this watch.

Pretty versatile, could wear semi-casual with a button up shirt, to business formal with a suit. Nothing too fancy, but decent quality for the sale price. I paid $65 for the black band and bought another one with the brown band for $75. Fair prices, I wouldn’t pay more for that with this one. And they are different enough that it’s not the exact same watch with different bands either, the dial is not the same between the different variations, which is goodOnly drawback is it’s a little boring, but boring isn’t always bad. If you don’t want your watch to domineer your outfit and you’re not necessarily trying to make a bold statement or stand out all that much this is a nice one. It’s not cheap looking,  but won’t wow anyone either. Just a nice respectable basic watch for different occasions",5,NA

It's got a nice weight, the color scheme (especially the orange second hand) is gorgeous.  The case is a brushed grey, a little lighter than gunmetal.  Simple and sleek! Can't remember the last time I had a watch with indiglo - love that! The watch brand seems like a decent quality leather band - it does take time to break in though, which I'd expect will lend to durability long term.Only minor downside is the lume on the hour/min hands is pretty weak.  But doesn't seem all that necessary when you have the indiglo lighting up the dial in low light.Time and Date setting was a breeze - pretty standard for anything with a crown.",5,NA
"85","watch","Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch","Chris D","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2016","","I haven't been wearing watches for several years but when I saw this I just had to have it.  In a world where there are clocks on our phones, our tablets, our laptops and computers I asked myself why do I need a watch? I pretty much summed it up as this. Wearing a watch is a classy, manly thing and I really did miss wearing a watch everyday.  So let's start again with a new watch. Besides, I now don't find myself digging in my pocket for my phone when someone asks me what time is it or when I need to look to see if my if I am running on time to a secret meeting with another covert operative for beers.This Timex has a classic design, with a rugged looking band that appears to be easily replaced down the road. I've only had it less than a week. But it feels like I have been wearing it for much longer than 5 days. I barely notice this on my wrist until I see it peeking out from my shirt sleeve or when I need to check the time. It has a solid feel to it but it doesn't feel heavy or cumbersome. I used to have a bad habit of catching watches on door frames while walking through doorways but I have yet to have this issue with this watch. Perhaps that might change when short sleeve weather comes around?The canvas style band is something new to me and I will have to get used to latching it. With one hole the band is too loose on my wrist and the next hole the band is almost too tight. I do not fault the watch for that small issue. After all, we are all built differently. Will the band stretch in time like my previous watches with leather bands or will it retain its current size? Perhaps in a few weeks or months I will know the answer to that question. As far as looks are concerned it has a classic military look and a rugged feel but by no means does it look like I'm trying to be tacticool. It is classic enough to be worn in the office, casually or in the park or at the beach. You could probably dress this up with a nice leather band for more formal office occasions or situations. But that is just a guess. It was instantly noticed by a few guys at work the first day I wore it into the office. Could it be that they are used to seeing me without a watch or just that it had a nice appeal to it? My wife likes the way it looks on me too. In other words, she didn't dismiss it as some trendy accessory and had nice things to say about the price.What about the Indiglo? Well in the dark it is easily readable. In somewhat dim light the hands seem to reflect enough light they they blend into the background and can be hard to see. But it is easier read without the indiglo in those situations. I really like the yellow seconds hand too. not too bright and just subtle enough to stick out of the black background. Does it keep accurate time? Since I set it after opening the box it appears to keep accurate time. It matches time with my Citizen, Fossil watches as well as my iPhone. If it loses any time I have yet to notice.What about the loud ticking? I don't hear it unless I put the watch up to my ear then it makes an audible tick. I have yet to hear it sitting on the nightstand next to my bed or even while wearing it. I have yet to get it wet, sweaty, dirty or banged up. But give me time, it will happen, I assure you. We will see if it stands up to regular daily use after I give it a thorough going over. I think with the classic styling of this watch it will look just as good with nicks and scratches as it does brand new. I am sure to add pictures and a follow up review down the road. I really like this watch and hope it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.",5,NA
"86","watch","Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch","K.S.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024","Quality for the price!","The Expedition Scout is an affordable quartz field watch. I found the strap comfortable and enjoy the simple design of the dial. The activatable backlight illuminates the whole dial surface (so you don't have to rely on lume plots) and is very readable in the dark. I was solidly satisfied with this purchase at first.However, 1 major downside to this watch is that the movement inside is LOUD. In a quiet room, you can absolutely hear the watch ticking on your wrist. You can even hear the watch ticking across a reasonably sized room if it's quiet, such as on your bedroom dresser at night. I found how audible the ticks are to be annoying enough where it detracts from the wearing experience.As my return window has passed, I will keep the watch as a ""beater"" watch for doing things like yard work or hiking. To be fair, the audible ticks are not noticeable during most daily activities, like going for a walk, going to the supermarket, etc. You need to be in a quiet room/location for the ticks to be noticeable. However, when I'm sitting down to read a book, or have a quiet conversation at home with a friend, I do not want my watch to be so audible that it's distracting or annoying.If it wasn't for the audible ticking of the watch, I'd give the watch 5 stars, especially considering its affordable price. However, I have to subtract at least 1 star because of the audible tick.",4,NA

It isn't fancy but it gets the job done at an excellent price. It is of great quality for its purpose, which is not to be a fashion accessory or wrist computer but to tell you the time and date. A crazy concept, I know.",5,NA

But then it decided to switch to military time (24-hour format), and suddenly I had to learn how to read it. I didn’t sign up for a math lesson when I bought this!After a crash course in figuring out what “14:00” means, (it’s 2:00 btw) I can now say I’m smarter because of this watch. Still, a heads-up would’ve been nice. 5/5. Because I guess it’s good to hear something once in a while..",4,NA

I would say that one issue with the white band is that it does discolor over time a bit.",5,NA
"115","watch","Casio F108WH Series","photogirl","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024","","I bought this watch so that I can wear it in the shower and while swimming without issues (although I haven’t done the latter yet). Yes, I’m the type of person who likes to know what time it is in the shower. I read the instruction manual and it says not to turn the light on while under water. I have made sure to follow that tip and so far, the watch is as good as new after daily use for several months. The only thing I’ve noticed is that the words “Illumination” and “Water resistant” have faded a bit on the outer shell. Highly recommend this watch if you want something effective, durable, and don’t need smart features. I had a Fitbit (now dead), but now that I know my sleep patterns are fine, I no longer see a need to replace it with another Fitbit.",5,NA

"122","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","A. J. Safian","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2016","","I read a lot of reviews for this watch before buying it. In fact I purchased this over the other casio watch Casio Men's MQ24-1E Black Resin Watch because those reviewers complained about the watch having too small of a face and band. Well, this watch I found has the same issue for me. I am an average guy; 5'8"", 190lbs, do a lot of physical work but not buff. I do not have ""cankles"" for wrists (or would you call them ""wrankles""?). Anyway, point is, just an average male. I bought this watch because honestly, ""watch stink"" from keeping my watch on my wrist 24/7 literally ruined my favorite watch (no replacement bands available for the unique design of the watch face). I had to go through two of these expensive watches to learn what the heck ""watch stink"" even was. But I was not going to throw down a lot of money on yet another of these watches. However being watchless was driving me absolutely crazy! My watch was more important that even having my iPhone on me! So I just caved in and ordered this guy. It was a couple bucks cheaper than the casio black analogue sister watch (link above). I love/hate this watch.In short I do not like this watch for the following reasons: the watch face is slightly small (just a tad), the band is not long enough and is veryyy thin. But I KNEW this before purchasing - I'm only saying it again for emphasize to guys out there. I also do not like paper thin watch bands. I like that thick rubber or nylon feeling. The thin resin strap is cost-effective and does its job, but it's so thin and flimsy I am always tempted to rip it off my wrist at least once a day. The length of the strap is not very long either. So the buckle ends up being almost on the side of my wrist instead of under it, like it should be. I'm at the 3rd/4th to last hole. The watch in person does not look professional.But the resin strap is really the only thing that reallllly bugs me. Aside from that I appreciate that Casio made this watch practical and useful despite its price. There are a lot of junk watches out there at the same price range. These watches will have their finishes peel off, scratch easily and will not be water resistant. They will perform as cheaply as they are made. This watch surprisingly differs in that regard. It's accurate with time, simple simple simple (love that part). And is water resistant up to 50M (just make sure the screw dial pin is pushed all the way in!). The watch face is simple, sleek, and easy to read. No funky numbers, small numbers or other distractions on the face. As much as I want to call this the perfect ""beater watch,"" when I think of beater watch I think of something that's extremely durable under abuse and will last- not so much the other line of thought ""I'll just toss it if it breaks and not cry over spilt milk."" I don't like throwing things away or using things that are prone to being disposed of early on. So while I want to use this watch for my dirty tasks like work around the house, while working on my car, working with animals, etc. I do not get the feeling that this watch will stand to much abuse. I will test it out though and confirm in an update when/if this watch breaks.If there was a $20 version of this watch - one that had a longer, thicker strap, slightly bigger watch face, and the inclusion of a small date window - I would buy it in a heartbeat! For about $8 though, if you are skinny/have really narrow wrists this is perfect! Also want to mention this is not a gender-specific watch. It's truly universal. Just because it fits on narrow wrists, don't let that fool you. Both guys and gals have thin and thick wrists. This watch is ideal for the narrow-wristed folks out there. Enjoy!",5,NA
"123","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","Eduardo Cuello Suazo","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023","","I recently bought the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch with a Black Resin Band and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. This timepiece beautifully combines simplicity with reliability.The design is classic and minimalistic, perfect for everyday wear or even for a more formal setting. The black resin band is comfortable on the wrist and feels durable enough for daily use. The analog display is clear and easy to read, making time-telling effortless.What really stands out about this watch is its reliability. Casio is known for crafting timepieces that last, and this watch is no exception. It has been keeping accurate time since the moment I started wearing it, which is crucial for me in a watch.Moreover, its water-resistant feature has proven handy in various situations, giving me peace of mind during unexpected weather changes or accidental splashes.For its affordable price, the quality and functionality of this Casio watch are outstanding. It's a fantastic value for the money and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.If you're in search of a no-nonsense, dependable watch that won't break the bank, I highly recommend considering the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch. It's a reliable companion that gets the job done while adding a touch of understated style to any outfit. Overall, a very satisfying purchase that I would gladly recommend to others.",5,NA
"124","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","San Francisco Bagger","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","Great Men/Women's Watch - thick-armed/wristed individuals beware though!","Nifty little plastic watch. Extremely light on the wrist; you hardly know it's there. No date feature, no luminous hands, just yer basic watch. Keeps perfect time. The description mentions a mineral glass crystal...nope. It's plastic, too.At 15 bucks what's not to like?",5,NA
"125","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","ameliapond","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024","","The watch itself is nice,  especially for low price. The band is more like a semi stiff plastic. I thought it was going to be soft like silicone bands. The little strap you tuck the excess band into pinched my arm once,  and to have the band tight enough to not keep shifting watch around my wrist isn't comfortable. I  ordered a few elastic replacement bands. I got the wrong size because it listed the width of band as 20mm. But the size you need to make it fit is 16mm. The band pins on this casio's band connectionis kind of hard to open. I used a paper clip to push the spring pin in (hard to get it to go) , and pull the band off at same time. The pin things on this are just straight.  Others I've used, including the replacement/ replacement bands I'm using have a kind of knobby thing attached that you can use to push in the spring activated pin. Much simpler. The elastic replacement band looks better than original and is way more comfortable.So, to sum up... watch itself if is great. It did come with battery already operating,  so I hope battery lasts a while, but no biggie.  While the actual watch is easy to read and the perfect size, the band that included is not great. A replacement elastic band (with 16mm size connection) makes the watch a 5/5. If it had been more expensive I would've been annoyed at having to get hew bands. But it's cheap and with new band it doesn't look cheap. So far its keeping time accurately. I also like that it's water resistant. The only negative I've found is the sub-par band, but new one can be gotten really cheap.Nice basic analog watch with a second hand, at a low price.",4,NA
"126","watch","Casio MQ24 Series","ameliapond","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024","","I like how well it fits on my wrist and looks. I`m a retired senior with alot of health issues right now and I don`t have alot of money to pay for a new watch after paying all my health bills. I`m one human being who doesn`t like purchasing batteries when my watch stops working because alot of times I need to also replace the band so I rather like to purchase a new watch. The price of this watch fit into my budget very nicely so I was able to purchase two of them to switch off.",4,NA
