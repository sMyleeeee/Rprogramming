##  [1] "As Planet Earth I was released about ten years ago, a visual improvement could have been expected due to the use of advanced technology, but man, did they up their game. The camera-work and the use of music were both truly superb, as well as the editing in which different sub- segments were all synced so well with the narrating of it by David Attenborough. It was nothing like a nature documentary, it was way beyond that. The short and different segments, were movies on itself. It contained all the different genres, from experiencing the thrill in a Hollywood-like impossible action-escape scenario to having a comical and truly euphoric moment of realization about the true extent of what nature has to offer. And this was all brought so incredibly well.If we had any more of such heavenly quality programs on TV, I would simply just glue my eyes to my TV and live out the rest of my life as a vegetable."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
##  [2] "I have just finished watching the first episode on BBC 1 and I am amazed to find that Planet Earth II appears to have bettered the original! The photography is perfect and Attenborough's narration, both content and delivery, is unparalleled. This initial outing is titled \"Islands\" and whilst I don't want to dwell on the individual segments, the Racer Snakes vs baby Iguanas is probably the most terrifying piece of natural history film I have ever witnessed, not for the fainthearted or squeamish!The \"making of segment at the end of the documentary proper was particularly enjoyable and informative.This is what the BBC does best and long may it last."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
##  [3] "What to say about Planet Earth II which has not already been said about so many other fantastic productions from BBC Nature?I've no idea.However: the production values are as always the very best in the business, the photography is likewise unmatched and it's all tied together with masterful insight and authority by David Attenborough, the man who through more than four decades has taught the planet more about the natural world than any ten others put together.Simply superb.The actual content?

##  [4] "The original Planet Earth back in 2006 was an astounding and refreshing series that tore down the limits of documentary making. It was universally lauded as exceptional, and if you haven't seen it then you're missing a genuine treat.Planet Earth II is everything its predecessor was. And more.Ultra sharp photography, iris-piercing colour and focus, and on a decent home set up, a superbly immersive experience. It is almost hypnotic the way the gorgeous landscapes and action scenes are interwoven with a sublime soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.The BBC receives criticism sometimes for the way it spends 'tax payers' money', but surely not for this. Whether you're aged 8 or 80, this is the highest quality television that will bewilder and astound.Truly wondrous, and David Attenborough is a legend."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
##  [5] "The professionalism of everyone involved in this glorious production is evident in every frame of what is seen and every second of what is heard. Most Hollywood blockbusters would struggle to compete with the cinematography on show here. Shot after shot seem almost impossible yet impossibly beautiful. Few things fill a viewer with simple awe but the first episode about islands does it and then some. The fact that it is all so enjoyable just adds to the experience. David Attenborough's narration is, as usual, superb.Whatever the cost it was worth it.

##  [6] "Hello this is my first written review. Note that I haven't watched the first season (2006) so I can't compare both.This series will get you the feels when you read a good book, watched a good movie, or played a good game, because this is more than good.THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE and of course with the danger of nature itself included.I don't know how they got those shots and the audio, even the music just like the rush when you first meet your crush, and the story with narration slaps you with the cold harsh of reality and the mesmerizing it gave. You are watching a book of life with enough drama and some bitter truth in every paradise, because life is never perfect.I'm very thankful for whomever people that makes this show to be realized, from the smallest task to the most dangerous.Thank you very much for this ineffable experience."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
##  [7] "By far the greatest and best nature documentaries ever made. Everyone needs to watch this. I have no idea how many hours it must have taken to film this, and it seems like the people who made this are totally out of their minds. The snow leopard scenes in episode 2 are so brilliant it's amazing. It's one of the rarest animals ever shot on film and they've managed to shoot so much of it. It's crazy. They deserve every little credit they get. I'm thoroughly impressed by the work put into this and i'm sure it surpasses the work put into any Hollywood action film ever created. I think I learned a lot more from these people, more than how much I learned from the content itself."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
##  [8] "This is without doubt the best thing I have seen on television for years. The photography, narration and general story telling of the lives of the animals is simply breath-taking.Episode 1 was animals that live on islands. As others have mentioned I have never seen such a more terrifying piece of natural-history photography in my life. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it or caught it on YouTube but I never thought I would be shouting at the TV for Iguana's to run. Episode 2 was mountain living wildlife from Grizzly Bears coming out of hibernation to Snow Leopards. This programme is one of the few examples which envelopes you in its documentary telling. You are seeing things for the first time and you are left with wanting more.

##  [9] "The opening image of Planet Earth II contained the promise of everything to come. It was spectacular, it was beautiful, it was magical. A hot air balloon floated like a snowflake, two miles abovean Alpine.The theme of the episode was \"Islands\", and we got off to a winningly cute start with a visit to idyllic Escudo, off Panama. Its star attraction is a three-toed pygmy sloth spurred into slow motion action by the cry of a potential mate. But no doubt what most people will remember, and talk about today, were the baby iguanas running the gauntlet of swarms of racer snakes on the Galapagos island of Fernandina.how beautiful our world and its living thing .....and how beautiful and big the creator of this whole universe ....I think people have to watch this types of films which is real one ."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
## [10] "One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen. Every episode is a new wonderful experience,getting to know the world that surrounds us. David Attenborough is the best narrator out there and this is his latest masterpiece. The crew has worked hard and managed to capture a large aspect of wild life whether it lives on a remote island in the arctic ocean or deep in one of the large human cities in India or United States of America. It shows that they put a lot of effort and time filming this under harsh conditions,but the close up captures of wild animals in their natural environment was worth the effort. Watched it already twice and will watch it again! This is something to watch again and again with your children, until the next Planet Earth arrives. Well done!"

## [12] "I never thought the original 'Planet Earth' could be topped, but 10 years on and Attenborough has given us something that is every bit as good, if not even better, than the first series.'Planet Earth II' is everything I had hoped it would be and more. Visually breathtaking, mesmerising and at times unbelievable, with expert narration by the legendary David Attenborough. Documentaries as awe-inspiring as this don't come about very often.I always enjoy the 'making of' at the end of each episode, giving us an insight into the lengths that the crew go to capture the footage. They deserve a lot more credit than they get. 'Planet Earth' is, without question, the greatest documentary ever made and a must see."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
## [13] "Was Planet Earth 2 good? Absolutely, it was a visual masterpiece with locations that not even the creators of Avatar could've dreamt up, animals we didn't know existed (literally) and AMAZING music.The problem lies in the fact that the \"facts\" given were all a bit loosely based on the truth. A lot of what was said is suspicion, and even some of it has been proven wrong in the years that followed. Some of what was said has been proven false even before the show was recorded, but because the most beloved nature voice (David Attenborough) said it, nobody questioned anything.Finally what really bugs me is why IMDb decided to put it in first place with only 70 000 votes and not even with as few as that can it sustain a REAL average of 9.0. It makes no sense why it is placed ahead of shows with millions of votes that average a REAL 9.3. I believe it's time that IMDb admit, this show is not #1, because the ratings don't say it is, put Breaking Bad in the position it belongs, and which it deserves."

Young people need to know their place in nature."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
## [16] "This is my first comment and I hope I am not bungling it.I have been watching nature documentaries for many years. Everyone of them has been a depiction of beauty of nature and the planet we are living in.With all the bloodshed and cruelty that is unfolding all around, committed by US human beings, it is a relief to the heart, so soothing to the mind and calming to the eye to see such an enthralling master piece. The mesmerizing scenes of birds, soaring in the blue sky, their sleek feathers glimmering in the sun, the captivating green of leaves trembling in wake of monkeys jumping over them, the enchanting scene of Nubian Ibex baby deftly climbing down the cliff, dodging the red fox, the eye relieving sight of flamingos parading in a single line and all the grandeur of mountains superimposed by the stars in the time lapse, specks of ice swaying down in the winter scene and all enrapturing beauties of nature playing out right in front of our eyes, it is all a reminder of how majestic this world is.The trance is culminated by the legendary voice of the gem, Sir. David Attenborough. He is a major part of all this beauty. All this fragile beauty and all the majesty of these creatures invokes a feeling in the viewers mind and heart that this world, nature, animals and human beings living in it are mystically intertwined, connected and linked. I also bow in respect to the crew involved in the creation of this priceless jewel, especially the cameramen, honing it to perfection. I hope more people watch such stunning documentaries so that they will admire life on Planet Earth."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
## [17] "Absolutely adore the first 'Planet Earth' from 2007, one of the best documentaries ever made and actually is more than that. David Attenborough (brother of director/actor Richard) is wisely considered a national treasure for very good reason, no matter how much he himself dislikes the term.So hearing that there was a second series nearly a decade later, there was absolutely no doubt as to whether to watch it. 'Planet Earth II' is as good as others have said and there is not much to add, it is along with its predecessor one of the best documentaries personally seen and most of the time it actually feels much more than that. Throughout it's an awe-inspiring, utterly transfixing experience where one forgets they're watching a documentary and instead feeling like they're watching art. This may sound like extreme hyperbole, but to me and many others 'Planet Earth II' is completely deserving of its praise and even deserving of more. To me as well, it is easily one of the best the BBC has done in years.'Planet Earth II' for starters looks amazing. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and habitats are some of the most breath-taking personally seen anywhere, whether in visual media and real life, the mountains in \"Mountains\" in particular are spectacular and \"Jungles\" captures the colour, excitement and formidable danger of the jungle beautifully. The rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normally bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter moments, Hans Zimmer's music here is a remarkably good fit, it's unmistakably Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances them.What of the narrative aspects? Can't fault 'Planet Earth II' in this aspect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surprise. In short, it's just fascinating, informative and thoughtful. This balance was even achieved in the \"Cities\" episode, that may have been the one that transfixed me the least due to being more invested in the animals and their habitats of the previous episodes.But the episode still managed to intrigue and illuminate, and credit has to go to 'Planet Earth II' for adhering to what made 'Planet Earth' work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nice ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers it beautifully, there's a soft-spoken enthusiasm and precision about his delivery and he never preaches.The animals themselves are a wonderful mix of the adorable (the penguins in \"Islands\") and the dangerous (the lions in \"Grasslands\" and \"Deserts\"), and one actually finds they're rooting for them in exactly the same way they would a human character. 'Planet Earth II' contains a good deal of suspense (especially in \"Deserts\") and emotional impact (\"Islands\"). Even the fights/conflicts against the animals are completely riveting, some epic moments in \"Jungles\".It doesn't feel like six episodes either, and none of the episodes feel episodic or repetitive. 'Planet Earth II' instead feels like a collection of six individual stories with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several.Overall, utterly mesmerising. For documentary lovers or fans of 'Planet Earth', 'Planet Earth II' is not to be missed at all costs and has more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding something new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
## [18] "It's a shame I can only give this breathtaking masterpiece 10 out of 10, it really deserves more. It is the single most astounding cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. The cinematography, narration, and score are hands down the best I have ever seen. Never has my entire family been so excited to watch the next episode of a program or movie.Planet Earth II lays out in 5 episodes life on earth in 6 separate Earth habitats: Islands, Mountains, Jungles, Deserts, Grasslands, and Cities. Each one dives into live and it's will to survive in a level you've never seen before. Truly remarkable cinematography and color will literally make you gasp for air and your eyes open wide. It truly is the greatest nature documentary ever made and possibly the greatest documentary of all time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
## [19] "Let me say the score, the music, the scenery, the animals and all the detail is like nothing you have seen before. When I'm dying in my bed i hope 60 years from now on my death bed this is what i want to be watching. It will give me peace on my way out of this magical and beautiful world. Just watch and see.

## [20] "This is not just one of the best wildlife documentaries ever made - superbly filmed using the latest techniques and equipment – it is one of the great achievements in any area of culture from this or any other year. Little else shows such skill and dedication from its makers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger than ourselves. It is an emotive evocation rather than cerebral narrative, and to this end there is extensive and prominent use of music, and added sound effects. Some find these intrusive, but for me they were very effective. There were a few occasions on which I felt that emphasis on getting in close went too far - for example the fighting Komodo dragons broke from the top of the frame unnecessarily, and the framing of eagles fighting over a carcass felt a little tight. However pushing the boundaries in any field can sometimes mean going too far, and this is surely trivial set against the scale of the achievement. Sequence after sequence is profoundly impressive, and the cumulative effect uniquely wonderful. This is of course worth seeing with the best quality source and the largest, best quality screen you can find. The Blu-ray transfer is excellent.In reviewing last year's outstanding \"The Hunt\" I wrote that I found it hard to imagine how even the BBC wildlife unit could surpass that. Now I see. Can even the BBC wildlife surpass this? Maybe Planet Earth 3?"

##  [1] "As Planet Earth I was released about ten years ago, a visual improvement could have been expected due to the use of advanced technology, but man, did they up their game. The camera-work and the use of music were both truly superb, as well as the editing in which different sub- segments were all synced so well with the narrating of it by David Attenborough. It was nothing like a nature documentary, it was way beyond that. The short and different segments, were movies on itself. It contained all the different genres, from experiencing the thrill in a Hollywood-like impossible action-escape scenario to having a comical and truly euphoric moment of realization about the true extent of what nature has to offer. And this was all brought so incredibly well.If we had any more of such heavenly quality programs on TV, I would simply just glue my eyes to my TV and live out the rest of my life as a vegetable."

This initial outing is titled \"Islands\" and whilst I don't want to dwell on the individual segments, the Racer Snakes vs baby Iguanas is probably the most terrifying piece of natural history film I have ever witnessed, not for the fainthearted or squeamish!The \"making of segment at the end of the documentary proper was particularly enjoyable and informative.This is what the BBC does best and long may it last."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
##  [3] "What to say about Planet Earth II which has not already been said about so many other fantastic productions from BBC Nature?I've no idea.However: the production values are as always the very best in the business, the photography is likewise unmatched and it's all tied together with masterful insight and authority by David Attenborough, the man who through more than four decades has taught the planet more about the natural world than any ten others put together.Simply superb.The actual content?

##  [4] "The original Planet Earth back in 2006 was an astounding and refreshing series that tore down the limits of documentary making. It was universally lauded as exceptional, and if you haven't seen it then you're missing a genuine treat.Planet Earth II is everything its predecessor was. And more.Ultra sharp photography, iris-piercing colour and focus, and on a decent home set up, a superbly immersive experience. It is almost hypnotic the way the gorgeous landscapes and action scenes are interwoven with a sublime soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.The BBC receives criticism sometimes for the way it spends 'tax payers' money', but surely not for this. Whether you're aged 8 or 80, this is the highest quality television that will bewilder and astound.Truly wondrous, and David Attenborough is a legend."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
##  [5] "The professionalism of everyone involved in this glorious production is evident in every frame of what is seen and every second of what is heard. Most Hollywood blockbusters would struggle to compete with the cinematography on show here. Shot after shot seem almost impossible yet impossibly beautiful. Few things fill a viewer with simple awe but the first episode about islands does it and then some. The fact that it is all so enjoyable just adds to the experience. David Attenborough's narration is, as usual, superb.Whatever the cost it was worth it.

##  [6] "Hello this is my first written review. Note that I haven't watched the first season (2006) so I can't compare both.This series will get you the feels when you read a good book, watched a good movie, or played a good game, because this is more than good.THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE and of course with the danger of nature itself included.I don't know how they got those shots and the audio, even the music just like the rush when you first meet your crush, and the story with narration slaps you with the cold harsh of reality and the mesmerizing it gave. You are watching a book of life with enough drama and some bitter truth in every paradise, because life is never perfect.I'm very thankful for whomever people that makes this show to be realized, from the smallest task to the most dangerous.Thank you very much for this ineffable experience."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
##  [7] "By far the greatest and best nature documentaries ever made. Everyone needs to watch this. I have no idea how many hours it must have taken to film this, and it seems like the people who made this are totally out of their minds. The snow leopard scenes in episode 2 are so brilliant it's amazing. It's one of the rarest animals ever shot on film and they've managed to shoot so much of it. It's crazy. They deserve every little credit they get. I'm thoroughly impressed by the work put into this and i'm sure it surpasses the work put into any Hollywood action film ever created. I think I learned a lot more from these people, more than how much I learned from the content itself."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
##  [8] "This is without doubt the best thing I have seen on television for years. The photography, narration and general story telling of the lives of the animals is simply breath-taking.Episode 1 was animals that live on islands. As others have mentioned I have never seen such a more terrifying piece of natural-history photography in my life. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it or caught it on YouTube but I never thought I would be shouting at the TV for Iguana's to run. Episode 2 was mountain living wildlife from Grizzly Bears coming out of hibernation to Snow Leopards. This programme is one of the few examples which envelopes you in its documentary telling. You are seeing things for the first time and you are left with wanting more.

##  [9] "The opening image of Planet Earth II contained the promise of everything to come. It was spectacular, it was beautiful, it was magical. A hot air balloon floated like a snowflake, two miles abovean Alpine.The theme of the episode was \"Islands\", and we got off to a winningly cute start with a visit to idyllic Escudo, off Panama. Its star attraction is a three-toed pygmy sloth spurred into slow motion action by the cry of a potential mate. But no doubt what most people will remember, and talk about today, were the baby iguanas running the gauntlet of swarms of racer snakes on the Galapagos island of Fernandina.how beautiful our world and its living thing .....and how beautiful and big the creator of this whole universe ....I think people have to watch this types of films which is real one ."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
## [10] "One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen. Every episode is a new wonderful experience,getting to know the world that surrounds us. David Attenborough is the best narrator out there and this is his latest masterpiece. The crew has worked hard and managed to capture a large aspect of wild life whether it lives on a remote island in the arctic ocean or deep in one of the large human cities in India or United States of America. It shows that they put a lot of effort and time filming this under harsh conditions,but the close up captures of wild animals in their natural environment was worth the effort. Watched it already twice and will watch it again! This is something to watch again and again with your children, until the next Planet Earth arrives. Well done!"

## [12] "I never thought the original 'Planet Earth' could be topped, but 10 years on and Attenborough has given us something that is every bit as good, if not even better, than the first series.'Planet Earth II' is everything I had hoped it would be and more. Visually breathtaking, mesmerising and at times unbelievable, with expert narration by the legendary David Attenborough. Documentaries as awe-inspiring as this don't come about very often.I always enjoy the 'making of' at the end of each episode, giving us an insight into the lengths that the crew go to capture the footage. They deserve a lot more credit than they get. 'Planet Earth' is, without question, the greatest documentary ever made and a must see."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
## [13] "Was Planet Earth 2 good? Absolutely, it was a visual masterpiece with locations that not even the creators of Avatar could've dreamt up, animals we didn't know existed (literally) and AMAZING music.The problem lies in the fact that the \"facts\" given were all a bit loosely based on the truth. A lot of what was said is suspicion, and even some of it has been proven wrong in the years that followed. Some of what was said has been proven false even before the show was recorded, but because the most beloved nature voice (David Attenborough) said it, nobody questioned anything.Finally what really bugs me is why IMDb decided to put it in first place with only 70 000 votes and not even with as few as that can it sustain a REAL average of 9.0. It makes no sense why it is placed ahead of shows with millions of votes that average a REAL 9.3. I believe it's time that IMDb admit, this show is not #1, because the ratings don't say it is, put Breaking Bad in the position it belongs, and which it deserves."

Young people need to know their place in nature."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
## [16] "This is my first comment and I hope I am not bungling it.I have been watching nature documentaries for many years. Everyone of them has been a depiction of beauty of nature and the planet we are living in.With all the bloodshed and cruelty that is unfolding all around, committed by US human beings, it is a relief to the heart, so soothing to the mind and calming to the eye to see such an enthralling master piece. The mesmerizing scenes of birds, soaring in the blue sky, their sleek feathers glimmering in the sun, the captivating green of leaves trembling in wake of monkeys jumping over them, the enchanting scene of Nubian Ibex baby deftly climbing down the cliff, dodging the red fox, the eye relieving sight of flamingos parading in a single line and all the grandeur of mountains superimposed by the stars in the time lapse, specks of ice swaying down in the winter scene and all enrapturing beauties of nature playing out right in front of our eyes, it is all a reminder of how majestic this world is.The trance is culminated by the legendary voice of the gem, Sir. David Attenborough. He is a major part of all this beauty. All this fragile beauty and all the majesty of these creatures invokes a feeling in the viewers mind and heart that this world, nature, animals and human beings living in it are mystically intertwined, connected and linked. I also bow in respect to the crew involved in the creation of this priceless jewel, especially the cameramen, honing it to perfection. I hope more people watch such stunning documentaries so that they will admire life on Planet Earth."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
## [17] "Absolutely adore the first 'Planet Earth' from 2007, one of the best documentaries ever made and actually is more than that. David Attenborough (brother of director/actor Richard) is wisely considered a national treasure for very good reason, no matter how much he himself dislikes the term.So hearing that there was a second series nearly a decade later, there was absolutely no doubt as to whether to watch it. 'Planet Earth II' is as good as others have said and there is not much to add, it is along with its predecessor one of the best documentaries personally seen and most of the time it actually feels much more than that. Throughout it's an awe-inspiring, utterly transfixing experience where one forgets they're watching a documentary and instead feeling like they're watching art. This may sound like extreme hyperbole, but to me and many others 'Planet Earth II' is completely deserving of its praise and even deserving of more. To me as well, it is easily one of the best the BBC has done in years.'Planet Earth II' for starters looks amazing. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and habitats are some of the most breath-taking personally seen anywhere, whether in visual media and real life, the mountains in \"Mountains\" in particular are spectacular and \"Jungles\" captures the colour, excitement and formidable danger of the jungle beautifully. The rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normally bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter moments, Hans Zimmer's music here is a remarkably good fit, it's unmistakably Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances them.What of the narrative aspects? Can't fault 'Planet Earth II' in this aspect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surprise. In short, it's just fascinating, informative and thoughtful. This balance was even achieved in the \"Cities\" episode, that may have been the one that transfixed me the least due to being more invested in the animals and their habitats of the previous episodes.But the episode still managed to intrigue and illuminate, and credit has to go to 'Planet Earth II' for adhering to what made 'Planet Earth' work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nice ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers it beautifully, there's a soft-spoken enthusiasm and precision about his delivery and he never preaches.The animals themselves are a wonderful mix of the adorable (the penguins in \"Islands\") and the dangerous (the lions in \"Grasslands\" and \"Deserts\"), and one actually finds they're rooting for them in exactly the same way they would a human character. 'Planet Earth II' contains a good deal of suspense (especially in \"Deserts\") and emotional impact (\"Islands\"). Even the fights/conflicts against the animals are completely riveting, some epic moments in \"Jungles\".It doesn't feel like six episodes either, and none of the episodes feel episodic or repetitive. 'Planet Earth II' instead feels like a collection of six individual stories with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several.Overall, utterly mesmerising. For documentary lovers or fans of 'Planet Earth', 'Planet Earth II' is not to be missed at all costs and has more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding something new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
## [18] "It's a shame I can only give this breathtaking masterpiece 10 out of 10, it really deserves more. It is the single most astounding cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. The cinematography, narration, and score are hands down the best I have ever seen. Never has my entire family been so excited to watch the next episode of a program or movie.Planet Earth II lays out in 5 episodes life on earth in 6 separate Earth habitats: Islands, Mountains, Jungles, Deserts, Grasslands, and Cities. Each one dives into live and it's will to survive in a level you've never seen before. Truly remarkable cinematography and color will literally make you gasp for air and your eyes open wide. It truly is the greatest nature documentary ever made and possibly the greatest documentary of all time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
## [19] "Let me say the score, the music, the scenery, the animals and all the detail is like nothing you have seen before. When I'm dying in my bed i hope 60 years from now on my death bed this is what i want to be watching. It will give me peace on my way out of this magical and beautiful world. Just watch and see.

## [20] "This is not just one of the best wildlife documentaries ever made - superbly filmed using the latest techniques and equipment – it is one of the great achievements in any area of culture from this or any other year. Little else shows such skill and dedication from its makers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger than ourselves. It is an emotive evocation rather than cerebral narrative, and to this end there is extensive and prominent use of music, and added sound effects. Some find these intrusive, but for me they were very effective. There were a few occasions on which I felt that emphasis on getting in close went too far - for example the fighting Komodo dragons broke from the top of the frame unnecessarily, and the framing of eagles fighting over a carcass felt a little tight. However pushing the boundaries in any field can sometimes mean going too far, and this is surely trivial set against the scale of the achievement. Sequence after sequence is profoundly impressive, and the cumulative effect uniquely wonderful. This is of course worth seeing with the best quality source and the largest, best quality screen you can find. The Blu-ray transfer is excellent.In reviewing last year's outstanding \"The Hunt\" I wrote that I found it hard to imagine how even the BBC wildlife unit could surpass that. Now I see. Can even the BBC wildlife surpass this? Maybe Planet Earth 3?"

##  [1] "I was born in Pripyat. I was four years old when the accident happened. Watching it is more horrifying than living through it. We didn't know what we were dealing with. It's not like a hurricane or an earthquake that takes you by surprise and causes massive destruction. Here everything looked normal, that day was just like any other day and yet you were told to abandon everything and just leave. The immediate casualties of the accident were not huge, but it had an enormous impact on lives of hundreds of thousands of people. I often think what my life would be like if this didn't happen.This mini series is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. Some people are complaining here that the actors don't speak Russian. I'm a native speaker of Russian and Ukrainian, I don't want the actors to speak Russian. You get so consumed by this show you stop noticing what language they speak.It's not a documentary, so not each and every detail is accurate, yet I would still call it authentic. The creators got the important stuff right... Both of my parents worked at Chernobyl plant, I grew up hearing stories and versions of what happened. I think this show is the best depiction of the Chernobyl disaster and the stories of its victims. This show is to remind all of us of the cost of lies."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
##  [2] "A Belarusian here, born in 1983. Parents were scientists, knew everything on the 27th. Chernobyl is never forgotten in Belarus and all the details of the tragedy (a flawed reactor, Soviet style apparatchiks in control, a failed experiment, a clumsy cover-up) are widely known. Yet the series managed to depict the horrible events in a way never before seen. A definite tour de force, I had to literally pause a couple of times to comprehend what had just been shown. Goose bumps and tears, what a masterpiece. Likvidatory - heroes, who contained Chernobyl - should never be forgotten.Grim Soviet atmosphere depicted accurately apart from some very very minor details. Surprised that a Swedish director who made music videos for Madonna and his English-speaking cast managed to portray Chernobyl events better, than anybody from the countries most traumatized by the explosion.The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
##  [3] "Hi. I'm from Kiev, Ukraine. I was born in 1983 and I was 2 and a half years when the Chernobyl catastrophe happened. I remember 1980s and I can tell that the authors of this film made a GREAT job to show every detail of what the world look for is in the times of Soviet union. The telephones, the clothes, the haircuts, the cracked paint on the window sills, even the door glass is similar to what I remember. There are couple of things which seemed weird to me: firefighters didn't have the red stars on their helmets, and most of the time people use the short forms of the names when they talk to each other (Vasya, not Vasiliy, Lyuda, not Lyudmila).\nBut the most important thing that this film shows is that the soviet authoritiies lied to people about this catastrophe all the time. For example, in Kiev which is 130 km from Chernobyl, nobody knew about the high levels of radiation till the middle of May, they even held a parade on the first of May, when the level of radiation in Kiev was 100 times higher than normal (iodine131 isotope) and nobody gave us the iodine pills. Everyone who tried to tell the truth was called the provocateur and could even be fired from work.\nI highly recommend to watch this film. This is a tribute to all the heroes who lost their lives in a radioactive flame and saved all of us from death."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
##  [4] "As my mother tells it, the weather was quite nice, the sky was clear without any sign of clouds in the spring of 1986. It was like any other day behind the iron curtain. Not a lot to do but not a lot to worry about either, a long day of boring work after dropping the kid off at the kindergarten, just to pick him up again at the afternoon, just like yesterday or any other day since the beginning of time. This is why she did not understand why the old lady (who she very much liked because she seemed to love children and had that neverstopping smile) told everyone at the nursery school not to let the children out to play, don't feed them the veggies and don't let them drink the milk we had for every lunch before that day. We lived in a hungarian town close to the croatian border and the life in that town was pretty simple apart from that day. We lived 900 kms from Chernobyl and we did not even know that place exists until 3 days later.Apparently a man who did not introduce himself called most of the schools and nurseries in the country and told them the same message. A lot of teachers did not take it seriously as he did not mention any details, just the warning: do not let the children out, do not feed them any vegetables which grows overground (potatoes are fine), do not let them drink anything apart from bottled liquids.Noone knew what it was about. Noone knew what danger we are in. I assume this is why it was such a shock. The life was simple and we were not supposed to know stuff. We were not supposed to be afraid, maybe only because the capitalist pigs over the iron curtain. But something changed that day. A faceless, nameless man risked his life and called everyone he could to warn them about Chernobyl. News like this is not easy to contain, soon everyone was talking about what could happen and why. Is it a nuclear attack? Is it the CIA? Are they looking at us from satelites? Are they bombing us?It was the first crack on the Iron Curtain. Not Reagan's stupid monologue, not the thousands of fleeing east-germans, not the soviets economy's ridiculous debts. Entire nations realized their lives mean nothing, millions felt betrayed. A man with no name defeated the Soviet regime with a few telephone calls.We still don't know who that man was. After 30 years and a few inquiries we have no clue who risked his life to prevent thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses. Some historians are adamant the person was executed and vanished without a trace, some say noone found him at all. All I know I have to be grateful for him. We all have to be. He saved a nation. Sure, we could survive the radioactive cloud the mild wind blew over our country but when I look at my two children who are the same age I was back then I am pretty sure I am not willing to take any risks. Would you?Dear anonymous man who defied a violent regime to save millions: We will forever be grateful. Dear ukranian workers whose names we will never know: We will forever be grateful. The workers whose names we know: We will forever be grateful.This show tells a story noone should forget and this is the right way to tell it. Bluntly. How the man with no name told us."
##  [5] "Im ukrainian, born in 1988 and still live here. I want to give the authors of this show a big thumbs up for the whole set they have made. Every little detail of the buildings, flats, uniforms, clothes, cars, especially big thumbs up for ambulance \"RAFiks\" (RAF-2203), almost everything is 99% identical to the real things of the time, just a few mistakes on some signs that have been written in a mix of russian\\ukrainian and some other unknown language, but it all doesnt matter, because what i have seen previously in other movies about soviets were so bad that its not even comparable to this. The other thing is this \"comrade\" word that almost everyone throws while calling or shouting at someone, its just one of those stereotypes thats still left in western world, in reality no one in an everyday life talked like that, especially not in Ukraine in 1986, it was mainly used in 'official' language in meetings and media, people just talked like you and i would today. Apart from this two small inaccuracies i am shocked at the level of production of this show, it is very good, no one outside of Ukraine has ever made a good tv series about Chernobyl before, i have a weird feeling it was made by someone from USSR, because there was zero moments where i cringed watching it. It was mostly \"spot on\", \"spot on\", \"wow, spot on\". Can't wait for the next episode!!!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
##  [6] "My husband grew up near Kyiv and his father drove one of the buses that evacuated the civilians from Pripyat. I have heard his stories of the disaster; the people's concerns, fears and sacrifices. We watch this together and he is amazed at it's authenticity. The set detail, the way the Soviet regime hierarchy functioned, the denial and secrecy surrounding the disaster. He tried (as he usually does when watching a Western production based in or about that part of the world) to find errors or inconsistencies but has not been able to - yet.The acting is impeccable by all, the filming is top notch, the sounds used to heighten the tension versus music. The way they are able to capture that exact feeling of anxiety, horror, disgust and sadness all rolled into one is admirable.I have completed the series and it definitely ranks as one of the best. This story has been waiting to be told and there is hands down no one better than HBO to do it. Russia has said it intends to produce its own Chernobyl program, it will be interesting to compare the two. Theirs will purportedly label the CIA as the perpetrator...."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
##  [7] "'Chernobyl' is scarier than most horror movies in that it is a dramatization of actual, real-life horror experienced by thousands of people on that fateful April 1986 morning and the years that followed. This disaster has haunted the nation, Europe, and the rest of mankind more than three decades later. And that creeping dread permeates the whole show. It's difficult to watch. But it certainly makes it a must-watch."

##  [9] "The first episode somehow surpassed my expectations for what this TV Show would do with the biggest nuclear disaster ever!\nWithout giving any spoilers besides the obvious, the cinematic quality is unbelievable! I found myself looking at many transition scenes with disbelief, a complete state of shock- that's how good the first episode of HBO's mini-series \"Chernobyl\" was!\nThe writing wasn't LEGENDARY but it was great, but most importantly, consistent! Every actor did an amazing job at portraying each character and their feelings, which ultimately, led to a even greater ambience.\nWhen the episode ended, I was left with a feeling like if I was in Chernobyl! I felt like I was contaminated by radiation. Although that might sound silly, I really felt unwell after watching \"Chernobyl\"! That just shows how incredibly effective the first episode was on displaying the horrific events that took place in Chernobyl, and how many lives were absolutely destroyed and affected following the disaster. So far, a must-watch!"

## [11] "This film is a beautifully made anti-Soviet and anti-Russian propaganda. How cost the lie? You can see the cost of this HBO Series to understand how much. 20% of the film is true facts and 80% hypocritical lies. The art of the producers is how the true facts are subtly woven into the web of lies. People who have never seen documentary films about this catastrophe will never be able to determine this fact.Some facts - Legasov was not a physicist, he was a chemist!\nAt that time, the Soviet Union was dry law and therefore no one could give a soldier or other worked people the vodka!\nLegasov's report at the IAEA was never challenged by anyone until now.Scherbina was an engineer by education, she was in charge of the energy sector of the Soviet industry and therefore knew the structure of the nuclear power plant well.Both Shcherbina and Legasov were communists (they were members of the Communist Party), and also were the elite of Soviet society, and therefore, as shown in the film, they could not communicate disrespectfully among themselves. Scientists in Soviet society greatly respected scientists.Legasov and Shcherbina did not attend the trial and therefore did not reveal any \"truth\".\"The bridge of death\" - that was what the locals called him before the explosion, because a motorcyclist died in this place several years ago. And it was just a local story. Since the explosion occurred at 2 am, no one came to the bridge, everyone was asleep !!!!\nCheck this facts himself and know how cost the lie."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
## [12] "I'm Russian, my father went to Chernobyl as a physicist quite a while after the explosion (a few years). However, he is still shocked of what he has seen over there. I think he will love this TV series...Anyway, I want to say that this is incredible. I've seen just two episodes and I can't find words to describe how emotionally deep is this film... The details of the Soviet life that are shown in this TV series are incredible. I can't imagine how hard was it to get to this level. It must have been a deep research with tons of interviews. Besides the details, the filmmaking and the music - absolutely unbelievable. Thank you for this. This is one of the best things I've ever seen in my life."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## [13] "30th of April, 1986, was a cloudless, sunny day in southern Poland. I was 13 years old, and went to school as everyday. Just before noon teachers started running, closing all doors and windows, and telling us to stay inside, that the air is radioactive. One hour later we were given Lugol's iodine (still remember its awful taste). There was discussion if we can safely go home. No one knew any details. Composition of beautiful weather and gloomy atmosphere was unreal. Years later, I know what was happening in the background. In morning hours of April 28th one of the stations of Polish Central Laboratory for Radiation Protection (CLRP) in northeast Poland measured radiation exceeding normal level half million times.Two hours later they knew it was reactor explosion, somewhere. Government crisis meeting took all 28th/29th night. Polish prime minister called his Russian counterpart, only to hear he \"knows nothing\" about any nuclear accident. By 3am \"Polish Legasov\", prof. Zbigniew Jaworowski from CLRP was called to join the meeting, and he achieved impossible - convinced Polish communists that the worst should be expected. They decided to give iodine to all children and suspend production of milk and vegetables countrywide, starting from the next day (east part of the country first).\nChernobyl - I've never written movie review. I've never seen such an accurate depiction of how communist country operates. How it looks. I was literally time-traveled over 30 years back. Incredible. 100/10. You know what is most chilling (for me)? 33 years ago communist Polish government, by some miracle, managed to react in relatively short time. Today - it's impossible. There are no iodine stockpiles. The network of Polish CLRP's 140 measuring stations was dismantled. What about other countries? I don't know, but...\nLast remark - my grandmother died in early 1987. Rapidly developing thyroid cancer. What exactly caused it? I guess I'll never know."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## [14] "In terms of series expression, it moves on in a style that we can call \"documentary-drama\". But there is a serious scenario success here. The visual and verbal emotions of the series we watch are sometimes causing anxiety, sometimes causing anger and sometimes we cannot prevent our eyes from being moistened. The gloomy atmosphere of the Soviets is very well reflected. The background music supports this. It has a cinematic narrative. You feel the catastrophe up to your buttonhole. Nevertheless, acting certainly takes the business to a much higher level. Chernobyl is now at the top of the \"Top Rated TV Shows\" list in IMDb. This is a significant improvement, even if you are a person who does not consider the IMDb score very much. Such a great success in a short time... It really deserves a round of applause. 10/10"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## [15] "Chernobyl is about the brave men and women who had to navigate the ridiculously scary nuclear accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in April of 1986. It is heartbreaking to watch as this shocking disaster unfold and even though you probably already know the story and what happens you'll still sit on the edge of your seat as tense as can be. This show will grab you from the very first episode and not let go. The attention to detail is just awesome. I can't recommend this show enough so if you're looking for a new show then give this a try, I promise you will not be disappointed. Just make sure you give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## [16] "Grim is an understatement.This is one of the very few shows that I'd bless with a ten star.It is subtle considering the subject but at the same time does not flinch in away from the harsh and immediate reality.I'll never love this show but I will forever have had my eyes opened by it.Shame on the Heathen that gave it 6/10 because of the English accents."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
## [17] "I can not overstate just how good Chernobyl really is! It's one of the best mini-series ever made, it's right up there with Band of Brothers! It absolutely lives up to all the hype and love it's gotten since it first came out! It's one of the top rated shows ever for a reason... because it's fantastic!

## [18] "I was born in Ukraine, 1971. Parents - Soviet \"intelligentsia\": mother was a high school teacher, father - medical doctor in the military. By the time it happened, we lived near one of the strategic nuclear missile site deep in Siberia. Every year, during the summer school break we used to go to Ukraine, where we spent most of vocation. It should have been the same in 1986, but Chernobyl happened. Official info reiterated that there is nothing to worry about, unless you are in the vicinity of reactor itself. But we all had learned to read between the lines and my farther used his military channels to find out EXACTLY what kind of catastrophe was taking place. He had some info from KGB guys themselves. However, he was reassured that Kiev and certain parts of Ukraine was free of the nuclear fallout and the level of the radioactivity was within normal urban level. He was also clearly warned where NOT TO GO under any circumstances: North-West of Ukraine and big part of Belarus was a heavy fall-out zone. They also mentioned some European countries. Needless to say, that nobody else was talking about this on TV. We made a decision not to change our plans for the summer, but keep in mind those warnings.Each of us had DKP-50A - dosimeter that measures the exposure dose of gamma radiation. We checked the data afterwards and all measures were withing normal limits or less. I remember though, that it was restricted to collect mushrooms or wild berries in the forests anywhere in Ukraine. Any dusty environment was considered dangerous. All water wells were sealed with plastic etc etc\nMini series exceeded my expectations. Authors put quite an effort to correctly depict intricate details of this catastrophe. As other reviewers already mentioned, I had noticed so far ( 3 episodes) only minor discrepancies in the overall image of the life in the USSR. People, behavior, political relations etc. Example of such a minuscule inaccuracy - officials, let along common folks, didn't use \"comrade\" as frequently as it might seems from the episodes. It was very formal, official form of addressing. Usually, after first meeting, they addressed each other by the first AND middle name. In the military it was different - \"comrade\" + rank (as in modern Russia, BTW). I'm looking forward to see the rest.\nI am thankful to the authors and actors for their job.\nMy deep bow to those who lost their lives and health, saving millions of lives.\nEVERYONE should watch this show and see for himself the kind of horror that can be unleashed in the nuclear war."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
## [19] "I work as an apprentice within the nuclear industry and I have to say without a doubt that this was the most horrifying thing I have watched in a long time. This isn't due to fact that the show is actually scary per say but it's is because the whole thing is true. This actually happened. Apart of my course so far has been learning about chernobyl so I know in detail the progression of these events and even still I was shocked the way that the show demonstrated how ignorant and naiive they where to what had actually happened.As far as the show goes the way it is desplayed on screen is mesmerising I can't even begin to imagine how it felt being there at the time wondering what was actually going on but I believe this show is as close a representation as we will get. The acting is excellent you almost forget you are watching a show as the reactions and emotions displayed feel incredibly genuine and beleiveable.The science included is spot. From my knowledge of how they understood nuclear physics and radiation almost 40 years ago this is very well done whoever was part of the research team was no doubt a veteran within the nuclear industry and it shows as I cannot fault any of the information that is passed across and it is done so in a fair amount of detail.Overall this is an excellent show so far and I can only imagine it will get better as it goes on and without a doubt will shine a light on the tragic events of what is easily the greatest human error of modern times. I highly recommend this to anyone who is unaware of the consequences of this event and hopefully this will showcase the safety precautions it had inflicted upon the modern nuclear industry as that is just as important as showing what went wrong."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
## [20] "As a person who comes from a country that was ruled by the Communism, I have a good idea of how it was, because we still suffer the consequences of the most inhumane regime in the mankind history and the worst of them are not the economical ones, but the moral.The mentality of how the actions, the conversations, the people are is right how it happened. There are a lot of great details in every scene: objects, colors. The clock I saw in the very first seconds of Episode 1 is something so common - it was present at home as well. The way the most vile and uneducated scums got promoted to the highest position is what happens even today in the post-communist countries - exactly as in Episode 2 and the ex-shoe factory low life that is now Deputy Secretary and who \"prefers his own opinion over the one of a scientists\" - this is devastating for a nation and its talents.But what hurt most is the end: that it's all based on lies. Of hiding information. As it happened in Bulgaria: the Government not only hid the disaster from the people, but the politicians of the highest ranking hid their families and were feeding them with imported products, while the nation was even left to go on the regular parade for the 1st of May. And then the Government revealed it to the people like something minor. And you can imagine the consequences that are still ongoing.So for those of you who want to know a bit more how it was living in Communism, how and why the Chernobyl disaster happened, for those of you who want to see a masterpiece of cinema work - go for the mini-series."

##  [1] "This Review is aimed at anyone who has never seen the wire, but may have heard about it from about 3000 people recommending you should watch it. I watched the wire about 3 years ago well after the series concluded, and watched it in the same binge watching way I watched The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Game of thrones. I won't compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn't about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore. I'll admit The Wire isn't for everyone, it may be too violent or complex with the vast amount of characters and side stories for some, but I guarantee if you are a film and TV series lover and appreciate writing, acting, and an abundance of interesting characters, the wire is pretty much perfect in these regards. Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series. Even small side characters have intriguing stories that progress throughout the entire series, and I have never seen more attention to detail. This show isn't built up with such high expectations for people who haven't seen it for no reason, watch it , and there is about a 99.99% chance you will become one of those previously mentioned 3000 people recommending it to everyone you know who hasn't seen it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
##  [2] "I don't even no where to begin to explain how much I love The Wire! It's a crime drama that takes place in Baltimore. It takes a gritty look into the lives of everyone from police officers to gang members to drug users to political figures, etc. The writing and acting for this amazing series is down right brilliant. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. The consistency of the greatness of this show throughout all five seasons is ridiculous. The gritty attention to detail makes this series feel so real. It's easily one of the best shows of all-time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
##  [3] "Along with TV-shows like 'Oz', 'Deadwood', 'The Sopranos' and 'Six Feet Under', David Simon's 'The Wire' was part of a revolution - qualitywise - in television. Although it is very entertaining, this isn't just entertainment; this is art, pure and simple - and the concept of this show was groundbreaking. On the surface, one might think this is a show about crime, but really, 'The Wire' is about the life and soul of a whole city. Every aspect of the city of Baltimore gets its share of screen time, and the way this is done - the writing, the direction, the amazing performances by the terrific cast; the music, the camera work, the realism... I could go on and on - is just outstanding. On par with 'Generation Kill' (no wonder, since the same creative team was behind both), this is as good as television gets.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
##  [4] "The Wire absolutely, without a doubt, lives up to all the hype and love it gets. The storytelling is so ridiculously good and that's because that this is one of the best written shows in television history.

##  [6] "I don't subscribe to HBO. A couple of weeks ago I heard an interview with a young actor from this series on NPR. It was described as a \"gritty crime drama\" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD.After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show.Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have seen.I do not understand why this show hasn't generated the buzz or the awards of HBO's other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don't much care about. That wasn't the case here.The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.There is no way to avoid having \"the best show ever\" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks \"what the hell can be done for all of these people\" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers.It's truly brilliant. If you like intelligent television, I envy the enjoyment you will have watching this for the first time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
##  [7] "I first attempted to watch this series over a decade ago when I started getting interested in films and tv shows in a major way, but I was still not mature enough to enjoy the more complex kind of TV I see that now. I used to think the show was boring, did not understand half of it, to be fair I am not from USA and some of the language in this show is a little too high level for a non native to understand from both the cops and drug dealers, even now I still don't get a few expressions they do or police terms. I guess I even hated it I only watched the first season and save a few scenes I was mostly boredNow I feel like my taste has matured a lot since I last saw it, decided to give it another chance, and now I see every scene, every dialogue, every line between the lines and I haven't even finished the first season again and I am loving it, maybe not yet as much as I love Sopranos or Breaking bad which are arguably simpler but very smart, real and entertaining. The Wire does feel more complex on its themes I guess it's too real in a way which is why I thought it was boring the first time, they bother with details normally other TV shows would skip or overlook.I still think Sopranos is better, it is easier to digest, but without losing that feeling of realism and being relatable on every level, but it doesn't make the wire any less important.I look forward to finishing it this time and maybe even update my review once I am all done."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
##  [8] "Definetly the most realistic show I have ever watch. You can feel for all of the characters, there is no certain good nor evil like the real life. Acting is also amazing, a piece of fine art. The Wire is a must watch show, trust me you won't regret it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
##  [9] "I have seen many brilliant shows, and The Wire is one of them. Even the word brilliant isn't enough to put into words how good this series is. The Wire is incredibly well made, with moody lighting, striking location work that also brings atmosphere and great photography, while the music is very haunting. The Wire with its thoughtful and tense dialogue also has some of the best writing of any show I've seen, the stories are ceaselessly compelling and the characters are rich and unforgettable. All the episodes are superbly directed, and very rarely do you feel cheated at the end of episodes. The acting is superb, Dominic West and Idris Elba are especially brilliant.

## [11] "I heard that during it's initial run that The Wire's creator David Simon had to convince executives to not cancel the show. Take a moment to digest that. Cancelling The Wire... You look at shows today, Riverdale, The Flash... all these PATHETIC shows that keep on running for no reason and The Wire, the GREATEST TV SHOW was almost cancelled.The Characters are so intricately crafted to mirror relationships on both sides. There is no singular 'main character' but a collection of talented actors playing the role made for them. OMAR LITTLE. One of the greatest television characters.Show, don't tell. Perfectly executed. The right song at the right time to clue you in.

## [12] "Possibly the best thing written for television ever; certainly the best to come out in the last 25 or so years.\"The Wire\" escapes the melodramatic pitfalls of shows like \"the West Wing,\" \"Six Feet Under\" and even \"The Sopranos\" (which are all smartly written--or rather have had their moments of greatness).Here is a show which over the course of 37 hours weaves together scores of very tautly detailed characters. It's not easy to watch--and its certainly challenging. But it is surely worth it.The story unfolds in Baltimore and is a study on the effect of institutions on its members: police, politicians, criminals, addicts.Some may find the show didactic. This is understandable because its creators make heavy usage of allegory (for instance, seasons three's not-so-subtle criticism of the situation in Iraq).Didactic or not, the show forces its viewers to think about and hopefully start a larger discussion of the issues it touches upon: the failure of the drug war, the gradual extinction of the American worker and the dangers of a presumptive, preemptive war.Hats off to creators David Simon and Ed Burns (a retired BPD detective) for creating one of the most interesting, daring shows in the history of television.Let's hope HBO renews it for another 26 episodes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
## [13] "I find it surprising to see everyone likes this show so much. Sure, the cast, direction, camera and writing are outstanding; definitely some of the best on TV, but I found the story to be lacking the entertainment value. I found the praised realism of the show to be too... real, to really be enjoyable. For a person who was in the army or police or had dealings with other uniformed organizations, the show just reaffirms what they already know. State organizations are indeed mostly governed by people doing each other favors, protecting their asses and doing as little of what is required as possible, while appearing to be doing their job. To a person who has little contact with uniformed organizations, the workings of the police department portrayed in The Wire seem realistic but unbelievable. While the acquainted person probably yearns to see another way to do things, the unacquainted hopes for the despicable vision to be finally dispelled. Not only does this not happen, but the last season shows that even people with the best intentions get corrupted and broken and the only way to manage to do something right is to lie and cheat while at it.I resented the show for giving me no closure, no satisfaction of seeing at least some improvement to the world resulting from pained efforts of the positive characters.\"A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? It's the sh*t that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come.\" - Lester Freamon. That quote summarizes the show for me. Those moments I was waiting for never came. Moments where I would think things could be different than I expect, moments where I would learn something new.I can recommend The Wire to people who want to get insight into how governmental organizations work. When having a beer with friends, if people ask me how it is in the Police or the Army, instead of explaining, I can tell them: \"see The Wire, it shows that perfectly\"."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
## [14] "I seriously don't get the hype regarding this show. It was so slow moving and boring. When I watch a show about the gritty streets or seedy side of any city, I expect there to be a little more engaging action. I don't want Michael Bay, but I also want more than one life to live.No doubt the acting is amazing. The problem is that some of the characters are so uninteresting. And the stories each episode that are not driving along the plot were so boring. I forced myself to watch Season 1. I couldn't even get into it. When it finally became relatively interesting, I was able to watch a couple episodes before getting bored again. I tried Season 2, but that first episode is mindnumbingly not interesting. Nothing drags you in. I said forget this, I won't be one of the lovers of the wire. I even tried reading episode and season synopses, but even they bored me.I get why many people are drawn to this show. It takes you deeper into characters' psyches than most. Bla bla bla. But at the end of the day, I don't care. I want to be entertained. I want to escape. This bored me to no end."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
## [15] "I say that without a shred of hyperbole. The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.This is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaking evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autonomous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given that we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institutions hold over the course of our lives. It's not unlike trying summarize a 1000-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your face. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.This point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird's-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it's near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does.\"All the pieces matter,\" a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it's understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show \"boring\" or \"slowly paced\" or \"overrated\" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two. I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.Instead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you'll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show's power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them. I chose to write a review which differs from many of the others here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is the best, or why I think it's better/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to provide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from others to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, that you'll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this country with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own. By this measure, your persistence and patience given to the show will be repaid 10-fold."
## [16] "HBO's \"The Wire\", another ground breaking TV crime series from David Simon who grandfathered \"Homicide: Life on the Street\", raises the bar for crime dramas by dedicating a whole season (13 episodes) to a single story with unparalleled realism. Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, \"The Wire\" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting. For realists only, this series will require some viewer patience while the complexities of the plot and the characters are developed. One of a kind...so far.

## [17] "Millennials will laugh at this time capsule of the 00's; Pay phones, pagers, the 00's cars, tiny flip-phones, cathode ray televisions...But this is GREAT TV! Excellent cast and production, story lines that are timeless, and still revelant. Great stuff !"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
## [18] "Hate to be rude but don't pay attention to the moronic post below. That was some of the most lame criticism I have ever come across on this site. I doubt the guy even watched the entire first season. This show is the best thing going on TV. Writing. Direction. Acting. Its all perfection. The people behind the show are former journalists and police officers who were covering crime in Baltimore or working the beat as cops for over 20 years. They know what they speak of and don't rely on cookie cutter characterization. This is the closest thing to a novel that you will find on TV. It is so impeccably plotted and so honest and realistic that I will never be able to watch another cop show (or any TV drama) without comparing it to this example of television greatness. Did I mention its also the smartest TV show on the air too? The Sopranos gets the media attention but it can't match the sophistication and grittiness of The Wire. The Sopranos is a romanticized TV crime drama by comparison. And as for Six Feet Under? Please! It reached its peak in its final six episodes of the first season and haven't lived up to that magic since. It doesn't get any better than The Wire. Universal critical acclaim. The winner of the 2002 TV Critics awards. The winner of the 2004 Peabody award.

## [19] "The show's writing is nothing short of masterful. David Simon, a former journalist, brings a level of authenticity and depth that is rare in television. The dialogue is sharp and often laden with social and political commentary, yet it never feels preachy. The storylines are complex and interwoven, requiring viewers to pay close attention as the show gradually reveals the connections between characters and events. This narrative structure is one of the reasons \"The Wire\" is often considered challenging but rewarding to watch. It demands patience and reflection, rewarding viewers with a rich, multilayered experience that lingers long after the final credits roll."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
## [20] "You want to get close to the streets? This is it, and what a true American tragedy it plays out to be. The drama is scintillating, without being sensational. These are real people, in real life, with real struggles, played beautifully by an incredibly talented Dominic West and crew.True politics, true characters, real struggles, genuine, small triumphs,and a lot of poetic moments that are incidental and not self aware. Gotta love that.Impeccable. Everything I always wished from a crime drama. Check it out."

##  [1] "I don't know when, but for me, Netflix started streaming Avatar and I was like my childhood, It calls to me. As I mentioned I'm sitting here alone in my apartment in quarantine rewatching my favorite show from when I was in middle school. 14 years later and as an adult I'm sitting here crying because of all the emotion that's portrayed in every episode. It's just so real. It might be the massive amounts of alcohol that I'm consuming on my own but I swear, this show is so heartfelt and raw. Practically every episode tackles loss, friendship, bravery and humility all tied in with some friendly humor. The show holds up so well. 10/10 would recommend even without the wine."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
##  [2] "This is show is one of the best shows ever created. There are many great lessons in this show that all people (adults and kids) should learn. The show delves into many branches of philosophy, including moral philosophy, that teaches people how to think critically and to always help and understand others. The show has a fantastic plot filled with great comedy and character development. The show has great action scenes as well! I highly recommend this show to everyone!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
##  [3] "OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.Of course, this isn't the first form of media that has incorporated the power of the elements, but their method of how they do it here is remarkable. For every element to be adopted into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies attributed to the respective element is truly inspiring.All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he's a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.The brilliance of this show is that it is perfectly paced. Sure, you get the occasional filler episode, but every episode (leaving out The Great Divide) has a purpose and adds more layers to this intriguing story and the world it is set in.Again, for a children's show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a 'kids show', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much. It's not pandering at all and tackles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.Sadly, after The Legend of Korra, Nickelodeon never seemed to follow in the footsteps of Avatar which I found upsetting. Kids need more shows like this, if I'm being honest."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
##  [4] "I'm not big on cartoons or the like but my husband had been asking me for years to watch the avatar. Well it came to Netflix so I said ok begrudgingly, thinking it was more so a show for him to enjoy his nostalgia and I definitely didn't think it would be enjoyable to see as an adult, assuming it was a kids show.I was very wrong! I loved the show, it's def one of my favorites. So wish there was more! It is humorous and touching, generally it put me in a good mood afterwards. I'll def rewatch it.The characters are all interesting and have great development. Scenes are beautiful. It's just a great show.

##  [5] "Even though Avatar is of American origin, it has a lot of Japanese anime influence, particularly visually, but keeps the best of both animation cultures with it's American sense of playfulness and more realized characterization. The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
##  [6] "This review will be very long. I adore this show with every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the show stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let's start with the story overall. Avatar tells a complete a perfectly paced epic plot over the course of 61 22 minute episodes. The show contains several unique and beautifully detailed characters among its main cast, all of whom are given consistent and engaging development throughout. From family related guilt and angst, identity dilemmas and the characters constant, overarching and looming quest, the characters are pressed with many trials which actually truly change them over the course of their magnificent journey. Aside from the primary cast, many intriguing and varied side characters appear throughout the adventure. They offer comedic levity, new forms of drama and help to add to the deep mythological and philosophical backbone of the show. All characters are exquisitely written and voice acted, with not a badly portrayed among them. Next I will cover the show's borderline legendary animation. It is a sight to behold indeed. I believe I am justified in believing that such stellar production values will never again be pared with this level of artistic imagination again, at least not in my lifetime. The scope, creativity and energy of the shows animation is second to no other show, and it's balance of colour is never anything less than sublime. Aside from sweeping and moving visuals, Avatar also offers fast paced and unbelievably well choreographed action scenes (once again, second to none) and well timed slapstick comedy. Not only is the animation stunning, it is also staggeringly versatile. The show's epic mythos is also very strong, and demands to be deepened and added to (thankfully Korra is doing just that). It takes inspiration from Buddhist, Inuit, Western, Japanese and Korean cultures to deliver it's unique world, as well as many original and creative elements in conjunction with the more recognisable real world concepts. The show manages to weave philosophy and deep moral concepts within its world and characters, creating one of the most fleshed out fantasy worlds of the last several decades. In conclusion, what can I even say? I love Avatar: TLA more every time I experience it, and it is one of very few shows (or even films) which can provoke a primal emotional response from me each time I see it, without fail. It sends shivers down my spine, and puts a tear to my eye, leaving me totally satisfied and fulfilled each time. My favourite television show, of all time."
##  [7] "I love it, it's amazing. It did have a few weaker episodes, but overall I can easily say this is one of the best anime I've ever seen. Most memorable too. The protagonists were very relatable and easy to root for. Although the show tried to convince us that \"the Avatar team members\" were just kids, they all looked and acted at least a few years older, especially Aang (he really doesn't sell a 12-year-old kid, especially in season 2 and 3). But that's a good thing. I liked it better for it. Prince Zuko is another great example. He was supposed to be around 16, but seemed more like 18, if not even 19. Again, I preferred it this way.Characters' archers were done splendidly. Especially Zuko's. His journey was by far the most transforming and I liked how he struggled to choose between good and evil. Aang's crush on Katara was cute at first, and I thought nothing of it, but then it has developed into something more, even if it did take a long time for it. Their love was definitely something to root for.And last but not least, Sokka and Toph. Both were absolutely amazing. One a warrior with a fun side, always saying something funny, but also really looking out for his sister and other friends, and the other a blind girl with unimaginable power. Even animal companions had their own characters. Loved it. And the finale! It was amazing. One of the best ones in the history of TV shows. \"Avatar\" really built up to it. Just go see it. I couldn't recommend more.PS: If you haven't watched yet \"The Legend of Korra\", which is supposed to be Avatar's sequel, please don't. It destroys everything \"The Last Airbender\" holds dear. You'll just end up depressed. instead, pretend it doesn't exist. Trust me, it's better this way."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
##  [8] "Avatar The Last Airbender shouldn't be underestimated. For a while I didn't even look twice at it due to it being on Nickelodeon and me being past the age of watching anything on Nick aside from the classic Nicktoons or Nick shows from the 1990s. But word got around that it was really fantastic, a sort of Kung fu style show where a master goes from place to place having adventures. Turns out the people I heard the word from weren't kidding: the saga of Aang, the last airbender and Avatar, who masters the four elements (air, earth, water, fire) and has to save the world by stopping the power-hungry fire lord, Ozai, is as epic as anything I've ever seen. It's an achievement of storytelling that creeps up on you, and while the first season isn't perfect the second season delivers episode after episode that enriches the characters and makes us care about them as we would in, for obvious example, Star Wars.In fact, the only minor complaint I would have against the second season (not sure yet about the third) is that it borrows quite heavily from the Empire Stikes Back (i.e. the 'one-who-will-save-us-all' mythology from Joseph Campbell is off training with an old master, feels his friend(s) in pain and danger in the future, rushes off before finishing training, bad things ensue, etc). But really, all of the characters get developed quite well, and if anything the development of the character Prince Zuko, a scarred son of Ozai who has been banished until he can bring back the Avatar along with his banished uncle Iroh, is astonishing in its complexity. We don't care about this character at first, in the first season he comes off like a whiner with Iroh as the wonderful comic relief (think Pokemon if the brother and sister weren't so annoying). But by season two a whole other dimension comes into play: who are you, and what are you doing with yourself? The trek with the three main characters, and the extra characters like Toph (a little blind girl who is one of those great bad-asses you have to see to believe), is one that is sophisticated enough to bring in adults, and for kids it's often just rollicking fun when it isn't deep or dark. The villains are convincing and scary, the humor hits when it needs to (and sometimes it can be just downright trippy and hilarious, like the second episode of season two, the Cave of Two Lovers), and the animation is often breathtaking. As they say on the internet now: it's made of Win!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
##  [9] "I grew up with this show and I can't imagine my life without it. It truly is not only the best cartoon series, but also one of the best series out there. With an incredible story, beautiful animation, amazing characters, great villains and awesome action sequences, it's simply flawless in every way possible.Season 1 starts off slowly but only because of the terrific character introductions and world building, introducing the lovable team of protagonists, Aang, Katara and Sokka, being chased by the angsty Prince Zuko, accompanied by his adorable and wise uncle.Season 2 is probably the best of the three, and introduces an awesome new character, Toph, and a perfect new villain, Azula. The animation also improves and is packed with action, emotion and epicness.The Final Season is also magnificent and the characters are at their best at this point, and so is the animation quality.Overall this show is a must! I've shown it to several kids and adults alike and they always end up getting hooked."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
## [10] "Hi there.It is September 2016, more than a decade this this series was done, and I will be your reviewer this evening.Our menu is simple -- we are only offering just one review and that review only comes with the very rare \"perfect score\" of 10. Sorry, no substitutions.I am a prolific reviewer here (over 1350 reviews) which is a polite way of saying I watch too much TV and have too much time on my hands.When I first watched this series I made the same \"mistake\" most reviewers do when reviewing anything for the first time. As good as it was, I \"assumed\" that over time something better would appear. But that never happened.So after 10 years I have given up. I just rewatched the whole series top to bottom and currently have a nice endorphin buzz going because this astonishing series just gets better as you go, and the final episode just plants a big smile on your face.Perfect writing, direction, story, dialog, animation, characters. And all with a chewy moral center.(And some really deep metaphysical concepts -- like the island where everything is connected. That is a reference to one of the oldest religions in the world.)I know what you are thinking. I tried to get into Korra but all I kept seeing there were the many errors the producers made in trying to improve on something which simply cannot be improved on.It is official. I am calling it.The best overall series in the history of TV.And it just gets better with age.((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
## [11] "This is a anime style cartoon that kids and adults will enjoy watching. It really is one of the best cartoon show I seen in a while, there is little to almost no flaw to this show. I really wished it was longer though, instead of just 3 seasons. It really is a memorable adventure, which has many elements that will keep your attention from beginning to end. Plus just about every characters in this show is memorable and not just the main characters either, and for a bunch of cartoon characters I actually cared about what happens to them. One of the best animated series I seen, and I highly recommend anyone that enjoys a good story in a cartoon to watch this amazing show.9.3/10"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
## [12] "I thought that Avatar when it first came out was gonna be another Nick Show flop. When the first episode came out I watched it for about 10 mins. and I thought wow and couldn't stop watching. The show I think keeps you involved. Nick has picked some bad shows but not this one. The plot is very well designed and characters are thought out and are dynamic. I think thats what makes a show good. Also the fact that when a show ends then next time then it carrys on what happened in the next episode rather than acting like it never happened. The show captures a sense of reality and makes the audience more into it. The writers write some pretty decent material. Classic comedy and new moral comedy with good values. All in all I give the show a perfect score of 10/10 stars with both thumbs way up."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## [13] "I've been watching this with my 5-year-old and find it's watchable by both adults and kids. The writing and dialog aren't wooden or simplistic. Although it's not at the depth of an Aaron Sorkin show, there is intrigue and nuance in the conflicts between Aang and his adversaries as well as among the adversaries themselves.It's this kind of writing that can absorb and involve a first-grader yet not drive his parents up a wall that makes this more interesting to watch than say a \"Fairly Odd Parents\" or Disney's \"Aaron Stone\". These are writers/creators who trust their audience to \"get it\" and who try to keep things accessible without talking down to the audience. That takes both talent and skill."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
## [14] "It's a well-written children's show. And if I were eight, I'd probably have rated it considerably higher. Or if it were being recommended to me by 8 year olds, or FOR 8 year olds. What's baffling is the number of adults recommending this to other adults, as if it weren't a children's show.I gave it an honest effort. I got most of the way through the first season, very nearly to the end, because multiple people had told me it gets SO GOOD. But really, it's a children's show. It may get good for a children's show, but as an adult it has virtually no appeal. The protagonists are annoying children, who do the same annoying crap every episode. The antagonist is an annoying child, who does the same annoying crap every episode. Mako is an absolute delight as the uncle, but that's like saying the ocean was wet. Mako is ALWAYS a win. He is a goddamned national treasure. Mako aside though (and I am starting to feel like a broken record), it is a children's show. There is absolutely nothing in this for adults, unless it is the nostalgia for young adults who watched this and fell in love with it WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN.So if you watched this as a child and loved it, apparently it really holds up and you'll probably love it again. If you're a child, for god's sake stop reading this review and go watch it. I'm sure it's fantastic. However, if you're an adult being told by other adults that this is SO GOOD, do yourself a favor and ignore them. It's a children's show, there's nothing in it you'll enjoy."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
## [15] "Where to begin with this series, despite being a series made for children, this is one of those rare shows that could be enjoyed by all ages. The journey that Aang and his team experience is some of the best character development I have seen with a particular praise for the redemption arc of a certain character which is the BEST redemption arc on television. The series tackles a lot of adult con-tent with humorous segments sprinkled in which helps balances the series out with a fantastic world not unlike anything else on television. There is a reason as to why this show has has persisted in the publics' memory and you have to see this to truly experience the legend of the last Airbender."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
## [16] "The art and research put into this story matches the quality of the plot and character development. This show is what Nickelodeon needs to give it some respect. Not since Samauri Jack has an American show been able to pull off an anime style that works. It's good to know that children that watch this show may actually learn what it takes to have a good story. The research put into the story is amazing. The bending styles all coincide with different styles of fighting and can be seen in every episode. The show itself is also planned out, as minor questions formed in one episode may not be answered for another 10 some episodes later, so it's not just another Nick \"story\" show like Danny Phantom, all episodes are connected and well planned out. I wouldn't doubt that the next 3 seasons are already written. The character development and writing can match even some of the best television writers out there, it may even be able to stand toe-to-toe with the works of Joss Whedon.I give the show an easy 10/10, especially if you watch all the shows in order."

I finished the episodes by the fistful, completing 3 complete seasons in 3 days.I never thought I would miss my friends so much because by the end of this series thats what the characters will be to you. I cannot express the sadness that creeped in over the last episode when I knew it was all going to come to an end. I would no longer get to see the wonderful lives of all characters I had grown to adore & take into confidence.Watching & experiencing this series has been one the most affirming moments of my life.I beg you not to go without experiencing the brilliant epic that is Avatar : The Last Airbender."

## [20] "I just re-watched this series that was my childhood and feel the need to express some feelings. This is the greatest thing ever created, period. All these other reviews can only barely say how i feel about this show. If there is one thing you must do before you die, this is it. There is literally nothing else you could watch, see, hear, do etc. that could top this experience.

## [21] "It is amazing. Truly amazing.No matter what episode you start on, you get instantly hooked and wanting more. I've probably watched this show 10 times because there is truly nothing else like it. If there is, I have yet to find it. It may sound silly but this show holds a special place in my heart because that is how much I adore it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## [22] "Recently, I replied to a thread on the Rocko's Modern Life boards, and I was absolutely shocked to learn that there were those who considered this as Nick's worst. Sorry, I disagree completely. Avatar:The Last Airbender in my opinion doesn't deserve to be included down there with ChalkZone and Rocket Power, if anything this is one of Nick's best shows along with Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy and Angry Beavers.The concept may appear simple and basic on paper, but as the show progresses the storytelling is grander, more epic and perhaps even more powerful. The animation is excellent, the music is great, the writing is consistently strong and the stories are outstanding in my opinion. And the characters, heroes and villains, have depth to them and are very likable. Avatar:The Last Airbender also benefits from superb voice work.In conclusion, this is a brilliant show and somewhat underestimated. 10/10 Bethany Cox"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
## [23] "I never thought I'd say this, but this is one of the best things ever on TV. It is so mature, yet so childish; the perfect balance suitable for anyone. I am 16y old, and I find this show fascinating. There is so much wisdom in it, yet collided with humor and plain stupidity that you just can't say 'No' to this show. I am just glad they ended it the way they did, without bumping out the money of him, like people did to many shows. It started so naively, and ended so gloriously. What really made this show are characters; each and every one of them - from the king of the Earth Kingdom, to the very Avatar. There's a mix of 'sweet love' of childhood, 'sweet pain' of it, yet there are losses, honesty, discovery of the depths of the souls and so much more.I watched whole three seasons in three days, and I was swallowing all that I could get. Of course, I will watch show again, slowly, to consume all that it can offer. But from what I've seen, I know that this show is something that everyone should watch. It offers so much fun for the younger ones, so much guidance and wisdom for the teens of my age, and yet so much of everything for the elder ones. It is no wonder this show has great rating on IMDb, but I think it deserves even more, just because it IS the BEST on the world.If you didn't watch it, go buy it, WATCH IT NOW, you won't regret ONE SECOND of the time you watched it. 100 out of 10; even more."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
## [24] "I remember watching this show when I was a kid, and I used to midly enjoy it (meaning if it was on, I'd watch it but if it wasn't, I wouldn't be upset about it). I recently decided to re-watch it cause I thought it would be nostalgic and bring back memories for me. I was disappointed when I watched almost the first two seasons, and realised how bad the show actually was. The animation style is good, and the story is also pretty good, but for some reason, watching it felt like a chore and even though I tried to force myself to watch it, I couldn't because of how boring it was.No hate to ATLA fans because I know how hyped up people get about the show, but it just wasn't it for me."

Bike pedals easily, training wheels are sturdy, and is designed to delight a 4 year old.  Love that it came in a 14 inch size.  Seat and handlebars are simple to adjust if necessary.  The only thing I don’t like about the bike are the white wheels, which already look dirty.  Overall though this is a great buy for a first ride.

Not sure why these little bikes need to be this heavy. My daughter enjoys it.

She rode it all over the house before we could get her outside. The basket and the handlebars were a perfect addition for a pink/purple loving girl. It’s a light bike and easy to assemble. Breaks are easy to use. And she loves the bell.  We’ve had it for 6+ months and took it on a plane when we moved and it’s still going strong.  She loves riding it!

It was surprisingly easy to assemble, says the bike mechanic dad who put it together. The birthday girl loved it.  All the cutesy touches makes this bike a hit. The only flaw is the training wheel bars are made of a less sturdy metal and more care was needed when attaching.  Though they seem to do just fine on the road.

It's a beautiful blue color with pink accents and a cute basket in the front. The bike is very sturdy and well-made, and it was easy to assemble with the instructions provided. The bike also comes with a kickstand, which is very convenient for parking and storage.My daughter enjoys riding this bike around the neighborhood and to the park. She says it's very comfortable and smooth, and she likes the adjustable seat and handlebars. The bike has both hand brakes and coaster brakes, which are easy to use and provide good control. The bike also has a bell, which she likes to ring to alert pedestrians and other bikers.The bike is a perfect size for her, and I think it will last her for a few years. It's not too heavy or bulky, but it's also not too small or flimsy. The bike is suitable for different terrains and weather conditions, and it has good traction and stability. The bike also has reflectors on the wheels and pedals, which make it more visible and safe.I'm very happy with this purchase and I would highly recommend this bike to anyone looking for a quality bike for their girl. It's a great value for the money, and it's a lot of fun to ride. My daughter says it's her favorite gift ever, and she can't wait to go on more adventures with her bike!

Didn't know about having to replace the tires and tube before sending the bike too the kid. Seeing the bike at first glance and her bright eyes then Seeing her disappointed cause she can't ride her bike cause of the worthless tires and tubes. You could off warn ⚠️ me about the tires. I would have gladly paid extra for the replacement.

Otherwise I am happy with my purchase . Make sure you read the instructions well and watch the tutorial , you can also refer to YouTube ☺️

My daughter has an easy time riding with the training wheels. The 1 star off is for missing parts. We were missing a screw, but we were able to find something similar. The instructions also were for a different version of the bike, but we were able to figure it out.

The bicycle is well made, easy to install and it has this little basket for storing small items like toys, water bottle and snacks which is so convenient. I recently reached out to their customer care and got a response immediately. Really happy with this purchase.

They even provide the wrench. It was easy to install the front wheel, pedals and handle bars. Then only need to attach the basket to the front, the seat and training wheels. The girls love them. Each girl has her favorite color. Luckily the bikes came in purple and in pink.I think the price is very reasonable. Delivery time was less than a week. I would recommend this seller.

The instructions are minimal but sufficient, and the parts are pretty self-explanatory.We got the 14" frame for our average-tall 3yo daughter and she has loved it.  She has ridden it 5-10 times so far (it's winter so limited opportunity).  She loves the pink and purple with flowers and a basket, which may seem trivial, but is key to getting a 3yo excited to ride a bike.We haven't shortened the training wheels yet and she is still figuring out how to use the coaster brakes, but the bike seems sturdy and, so far, well worth the money.

Looks nice.  It's reasonably light weight.  Not quite used to the shifting yet, but the bike is pretty quick without much effort.  Took 5 minutes to set up with the tools provided.  Though, you're better off using a real screwdriver and wrenches if you have them.The only downside is the seat.  It's rock hard, and without rear shocks, it's pretty uncomfortable.

Bike took some time to assemble but came together pretty easily.  Issues:The wheels are not straight and contact the brake pads sporadically while riding, making a scrubbing sound.  I made significant adjustments to the brake pad spacing but could not easily dial it in to the spacing referenced in the manual - needed wider spacing to avoid contacting the tire.The derailleurs were not indexed properly.  I followed the instructions step by step to set the low and high limits, then adjusted the thumbscrews to adjust the indexing.  I spent 4 hours (not exaggerating) adjusting and could not get the shifting to work properly - it skipped gears, and the bike would often shift gears on its own while pedaling.  Front derailleur was trash, could never get it to shift into the smallest gear.  The shifters were “tight” especially for the front gearing, my son couldn’t even shift it to the smallest gear because it was so tight.Ultimately I decided to return it, too much wasted time trying to make it functional.  Don’t waste your time on this bike, it’s trash just like many of the other reviewers said.  I wish I’d listened to them, but I was attracted to the positive reviews and the price seemed reasonable.At the very least, don’t trash the box after buying it, because you can’t return it without the box.  I had to buy a $20 bike box just to return it after trashing the original box (which was damaged on the bottom).  Fortunately Amazon covered the cost of the bike box and made this return process pretty easy.

The only thing is the front wheel came in and the rim is a little bent. Other than that great bike for the price.

I originally was going to purchase the 20 inch til I saw for a "girl" I assumed this meant a child. YES I am short 5 feet. So then I went looking for a 22 inch.I could not find one.Now my 2 brothers growing up had the sting ray cool looking Huffy bikes. So I strictly surfed HUFFY Mountain Bikes still NO 22 inch, what did I know, I have not ridden a bike in 37,38 years, lol, lol. The info on inches and heights was there right in front of me..This AWESOMELY made, relatively easy to put together, took about 1 1/2 hours>PERFECT!. I watched the video which clearly walks you through the entire process.

It keeps tilting back when I sit on it. I literally cannot tighten the nuts anymore. The seat is going to have to be replaced. Really pisses me off.This is a pretty good bike. I got this bike after spending years riding my mon's old Giant(which costs about $500 in today's money), and while it doesn't quite measure up to that one, it still feels pretty comfortable. It rides smoothly, and the gears are noticeably different from each other. I switch gears a lot when going against the wind or going up or down hill, so it was important the gears worked well.I brought it to a bike shop to put together instead of doing it myself to avoid any problems from poor assembly. Early on I had an issue with the right brake sticking, and I took it to the bike shop that put it together but it unstuck at that point and the bike shop couldn't see any problem. The brake hasn't stuck since, so it could just be that the bike needed breaking in.A bigger issue with the brakes is that they're simply too short. I can't comfortably rest my fingers on them when I'm riding (which you should always do to be safe). I can only really get one finger on them. The brakes are only half the size of the handle, and the inner part of the handle is taken up by the gear mechanism, so I can't put my hands any closer to the brakes without accidently changing the gears. Seeing as this is a women's bike, and women have smaller hands then men, this is strange. It's a minor issue though.Overall I'm really happy with this bike, especially considering I didn't have much of a choice since it seems there's a bike shortage because of the pandemic.

I hope it will stay firm. I think it may be loose parts like seat .  The instructions are difficult to follow my husband used his common sense to do it. I looked up the Google search camera for the parts.

It was nice it came with the basket and the doll chair on the back. The bell is also a nice addition.  The bike seems to be comfortable for kids to ride on. Frame came in good condition and the color was what was expected. The only issues is the front brake needed a lot of adjustment, it wasn’t a huge issue as the caster brake is the main brake in the bike. But it took quite a bit of adjustment to get the front brake to work at all.

So you have to make judgement calls for baby seat, reflectors and had to adjust the spokes.

She's small so I ordered the 14", with seat at its lowest it fits her perfectly with plenty of room to grow. I was so impressed by how well it was packaged, directions, and the quality of the bike and parts. It is a heavy duty frame, has the front brake, very nice wide vintage seat that even has springs under it, thick pedals, fenders, even safety covers for any exposed bolts, and of course all the bells and whistles baby seat, basket, bell, and Papa & I only argued once putting it together lol. To this Grammy it was worth every penny and she absolutely loved it!

It took way longer to put together than I anticipated. The instructions weren’t stellar and the pictures didn’t always match the parts. The front brakes still aren’t adjusted correctly but I’ve given up on that. I also had difficulty tightening the handlebars but that just might have been me.Overall it’s a really cute bike. She loved the basket and the seat on the back for her baby. As other reviews said, the seat and basket are flimsy but functional.

It’s designed with safety, ease of use, and comfort in mind, making it a great option for kids learning to ride or upgrading from their first bike. My daughter loves it and I will be buying one for my son when he gets bigger.

Assembly was moving along fine until I got to installing the fenders. The two fenders are different, but the instructions lack enough detail to determine which goes where.  Then I was dismayed to discover that the lock nut that needed to be removed, in order to install the front fender, had been threaded on past it's lock point.  Much frustration and two hours later, I finally got it off, but the brake assembly mounting bolt was stripped.  The entire forward brake assembly had to be removed.  Fortunately, this is a training bike and also has a back-pedal brake.  The final insult to injury was that the instructions for mounting the rear reflector were just wrong. They didn't match the hard mount point on the bike at all.Recommendations for management:1. Update the assembly instructions. Most problems could have been avoided with more detailed / accurate instructions.2. Don't use lock nuts on an assembly like this, if you can't guarantee that the monkeys doing the preassembly won't overtighten them.UPDATE - 31 MAY 2024After submitting my initial review, the seller offered a full refund.  No conditions were mentioned.  Then they came back stating that the bicycle needed to be returned in order to receive the refund, and asked if I'd already assembled it.  As indicated in my initial review, it's already fully assembled.  My daughter's birthday is tomorrow, so we're out of time to fix this.  Reducing star rating to one.

Missing seat piece . Put it all together and can’t get seat on, what a let down for an excited child who eagerly awaited it to come. So we then found an old bike and were able to use that seat and clamp, my son used the bike for all of 15 mins and the brakes gave out on him and the back wheel stopped. He brought the bike to our porch smelling of burning rubber. Will never buy a joystar bike, poorly made didn’t even last one day!

Assembly was pretty straightforward, although the instructions provided no guidance as to how to get the front wheel past the brakes when installing it.  I removed one brake pad and then reinstalled it after passing the wheel through the brakes.  Everything else was a breeze, and everything fit together perfectly, with no missing or broken pieces.This bike is SOLID.  I am very impressed with the quality for this price.  The paint finish looks really nice.  The shifters are smooth and easy to operate.  The brakes do not require a lot of force to bring the bike to a quick stop.  I was not sure what to expect from this brand I had not heard of, but this really is a great bike.

Smooth rolling and brakes good. It may not have top tier parts but it gets me from point A to B without issues. The tires are decent in wet condition with no issues on slipping. The frame is steel and no replaceable derailleur hanger. Overall, the front forks help absorb some bump for a smoother ride and shift gears good.

It came more assembled than I excepted, easy to finish the assembly and get the rideable.  It's sort of a mountain bile but really a decent town cruiser.  It has cheap tires and could benefit by nicer tires, they are rated for 198lbs and 40 psi. The brakes work fine and were easy to adjust. I like the feel of it on the road.  I am using it as a fun little shop cruiser to run errands.

I feel my way through the gears based on the resistance, so this is not a deal breaker, but detracts from the overall quality of the bike.The packaging is excellent, there is no movement of any of the parts, so no scratched paint.  It contains the tools and parts necessary for assembly and the assembly is straight forward.  They have included the nuts on the cross bar to add a water bottle or pump.Overall, it is easy to assemble and rides fairly well, but I believe the price is a bit high for the quality issues mentioned, so look for a good sale.

The bike's lightweight design and low frame make it easy for toddlers to handle and get on and off.Stability with Training Wheels:The training wheels provide much-needed stability for beginners, helping young riders focus on pedaling without worrying about balance. It’s a great way for toddlers to gain confidence as they learn to ride.Fun Accessories:The bike includes a basket, bell, and rear rack, which add fun and functionality to the ride. The basket is perfect for carrying small toys or snacks, and the bell encourages kids to practice signaling or just adds to the enjoyment. The rear rack is mostly decorative but can also be used for light items.Sturdy Construction:The bike features a solid steel frame that can withstand the wear and tear typical of early childhood use. The tires provide adequate traction on smooth surfaces like sidewalks and bike paths.Cons:Longer Assembly Time (1 Hour):Assembly took about an hour, which is much longer than the expected "90% preassembled" claim. Although the bike comes mostly assembled, you’ll still need to attach the front wheel, pedals, handlebars, and adjust the seat. For parents hoping for a quick setup, this extra time required could be frustrating. The instructions can be a bit unclear at times, adding to the challenge.Limited Adjustability:The seat and handlebars are adjustable, but the range of adjustment is somewhat limited. Taller kids might outgrow this bike faster than expected. For children closer to the upper end of the 2-4 year range, the bike may not fit them comfortably for long.Training Wheels Hard to Remove:Like many bikes with training wheels, the process of removing them once your child is ready to ride without them can be a bit difficult. Some parents report that the training wheels don’t come off as easily as expected, making the transition to riding without them slower than desired.Not Suitable for Rough Terrain:The bike is designed primarily for smooth, flat surfaces. It won’t perform well on rough or uneven terrain, limiting its use to sidewalks, bike paths, and driveways.Overall Verdict:This 12-inch kids bike has a solid build and fun features, making it a good choice for toddlers just learning to ride. The 1-hour assembly time—much longer than the advertised "90% preassembled" claim—may be a dealbreaker for parents hoping for a quick setup. While the bike is mostly preassembled, the extra steps required to get it ready to ride, combined with unclear instructions, can make the process frustrating.Despite this, the bike offers stability with training wheels, fun accessories (like a basket and bell), and a durable frame that should hold up over time. It's a great option for young children, though the assembly time and limited adjustability for growing kids keep it from earning a higher rating.

The basket and bell add a fun element, while the rear rack is surprisingly useful for carrying small items, like a small pack or lunch bag. Overall, it's a great option for little ladies beginning their cycling journey.

Quality is good and very well made, basket in the front is just so adorable and she takes her doll in the basket everyday. Very easy to assemble. I was able to make it in less than 20 minutes, it’s a perfect gift for the Christmas!

It's a great little bike, and a pretty good price for the quality of it.

My niece wanted a bike for her birthday. Her mom’s request was that it be something not too girly so my nephew could ride it when she out grows it. This shiny bike fit the bill perfectly! We jazzed it up with some lights and fringe and bam! Perfect gift.Shipped in a timely mannerAssembly was easy but beware, there are some sharp pieces of metal. My boy friend cut his hand a few times but with a little sandpaper was able to remedy the problem areas.

The bike's design is both sturdy and stylish, making it appealing to my child while giving me confidence in its safety and durability. The size options are great, allowing for a perfect fit for children of various ages and heights.Assembly was straightforward, with clear instructions. The inclusion of training wheels for the younger ages is a great feature, providing stability for beginners and making the learning process more enjoyable and less intimidating. The bike's performance is smooth, and the adjustable seat and handlebar heights are a great bonus, allowing the bike to grow with my child.Most importantly, my child finds the bike comfortable and fun to ride, which has encouraged more outdoor play and physical activity. The JOYSTAR Kids Bike is an ideal choice for parents looking for a reliable, safe, and enjoyable bike for their children. Highly recommended!

There was no damage to the box, so it could not have happened in transit. Not sure how this made it through quality checks. A replacement has been ordered. I will update this review once it arrives.*Update*Replacement was supposed to be delivered today, but it has been delayed. I understand things happen, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't compound my frustration.*2nd Update*New bike was delivered. Easy enough to assemble. No obvious defects this time. Kiddo loves it. Changed from 1star to a 3star.*Final Update*We're back to 1 star. The front tire is not holding air. I couldn't be more disappointed with the quality of this bike. Fortunately we had a spare tire we pulled from a balance bike that never gets used. We'll see how long that lasts, but I will never buy from this company again. I hope you have better luck than we did.

We had some hiccups with the wheels. I was outside the return window. They actually sent me an entire bike! Now that is service! Thank you JoyStar!!!

He was apprehensive at first sight, because it’s wobbly with training wheels (so they can gradually become more stable), but he quickly got the hang of it!!The price was good, but I think you can get cheaper bikes at wal mart.

Originally I got the bike but the tire didn’t fit. I contacted customer service and they sent a new one out the same week. It’s a nice bike. Easy to put together and easy to handle.

Didn’t take long to set up and my daughter put her favorite stuffed animal in the basket and took off. The 16” appears to be a good fit for her, she’s 6 years old on the small side, she’s 3’8. My only dig is that the bell was missing. Its enough to dock them a star in my mind, the box came to the house and it had been opened. Probably not their fault, maybe it fell out, maybe someone took it, who knows, daughter doesn’t even know it came with one but I’ll end up picking one up somewhere for her. Training wheels seem good, makes the bike very stable, happy with the purchase.

It was easy to use and was on perfect condition. The stability was great. The only thing that need to improve is having a user friendly manual. I think the manual was complicated

I assembled it following all instructions but the brakes dont work. The pedals too are very difficult to pedal. My 3yr old is unable to ride it. I took it to a bike repair shop to fix but this product is so cheaply made even the professionals cannot fix it. Camt return as the return window is closed. Also it comes with few missimg parts.

Everything about the bike is super cute like the picture. The handle bars and seat adjust to the perfect height. The tires were not filled with air, so while filling them the inner tube kept twisting out of the tire wall making the tire uneven. It was very difficult to get it adjusted inside again.  Once that was fixed which took a while, the bike rode well and my daughter loves her new bike.

All of my bikes have always been purchased from a brick-and-mortar store. Due to COVID, this was my only choice to get my son his present. The item arrived with a hole in side of the box, and the front axle was poking out. Luckily, nothing was damaged. Everything else looked to be intact, and of course there were no instructions. Being the bike mechanic for all the kids in the neighborhood, I didn't need the directions. I agree with all of the other reviewers that this bike needs to be assembled and tuned up from top to bottom.Here is what I experienced: Some parts (stem, wheels, chain) were very tight; the crank was unusually loose and later discovered during a test ride. The stem was so tight, it would not rotate. This had to be fixed before the handlebars were mounted. It was loosened, adjusted, and realigned. Then the handlebars were mounted. While adjusting the cable for the front brakes, the cable loop (which is simply spot welded) broke off. This was easily fixed with a cable tie. Front and rear axles needed to be loosened a bit to rotate freely. I also checked to make sure they were greased (luckily they were). The rear wheel was adjusted so tight, that the chain would most likely snap. I loosen the steel nut on the adjusting bolt (near the cassette) to give the chain a small amount of play. The rear axle pegs were then tightened, and the chain tension rechecked. The rear brake cable was adjusted so that it fed into the clamp from the outside. This allowed for proper clearance between the bare cable and the seat tube. During the test ride, the crank nut loosened to where I was able to spin it with my fingers. The chain wheel was also wobbling. I removed the crank nut completely to get access to the fasteners by the chain wheel. Once every nut on the crank was tightened back up, I rode the bike again. This bike rides fine, and is not too heavy (about 30 lbs.).  The brakes work fine, but the pads are terrible. If I plan to relive my "Rad" (the Hal Needham movie) days, I will have to swap the pads for some Kool Stops. I am giving this item four stars because it is essentially a China knock-off of the Mongoose Legion, but it does the job. The price (costs more than a Mongoose!?) is only inflated because of COVID.

I purchased the first time and after putting together realized both wheels (not tires) were warped. This made it impossible to ride because 1) the bike would wobble and 2) the brakes would rub on half the wheel and then not touch when braking on the other half of the wheel.I returned the bike and requested a replacement. The replacement arrived within a week and the wheel problem was correct. I put the bike together and upon airing up the tires realized the back had a leak. I ordered an inner tube for it and replaced it. I pumped up the tire. Immediately the tire had a leak again. I compared the two leaking inner tubes and the leak was in the same place. I removed the tire from the wheel to inspect and discovered that several of the wheel spokes, which are attached to the inner side of the wheel (where the inner tube rests between the wheel and tire) were jagged and sharp, which was puncturing the tube when inflated.Extremely poor quality and unsafe for a child. You’re better off buying an $80 bike at Walmart.

He’s 12, 5’7” and 210. He ADORES this bike.  He insisted I write a very positive review. He says it rides smooth and has been riding on it non stop which is crazy, cuz he loves to be on the internet.  He was in the hospital unexpectedly this week and and this arrived a day later.  It just uplifted his spirits so much.  Excellent bike.  THANK YOU!!!!!

## 121 First and foremost, I should note that you need to know something about bike maintenance....well, actually....you need to know everything about bike maintenance if you're planning on buying this for your child and putting it together yourself. If you don't know how to maintain a bike, I suggest taking it to a bike store to getting it checked. Specifically (based on my experience putting two of these together now), at the very least you should look out for the following issues that I found on either both, or one or the other of the two bikes that I purchased for my kids:1. Brake cables not oiled (unexpected).2. Brake cables not properly adjusted (somewhat expected, but one was really, really off).3. Brake pad adjustments required after installing the front wheel (expected).4. Grease various parts (expected - handle bar joints, seat post. Unexpected - kickstand spring/mechanism).5. Check tightness of brake hand levers (expected, I guess).6. Fully deflate and reposition inner tube inside the tire (unexpected).7. Remove buckle from rear wheel!!! (Yikes - that was totally unexpected - see the video).8. Check every bolt on the bike to ensure reasonable tightness for the purpose (expected, I guess, and there was one loose bolt on the rear wheel, so please do check).9. Oil bike chain and inflate tires (totally expected).In essence, it seems that there is not a great deal of concern about the final stages of manufacturing of these bikes, i.e., the stage where they're basically putting all the parts together. Having said that, the bike design is quite good and suitable for normal bike riding (not for tricks, freestyle, racing, etc.). The manual that came with the bikes was not specific for this model, but was general for several of the models that they sell. It was well-written and generally easy to comprehend. The paintwork, tires, frame construction, and individual components (brake parts, pedals, kick stand, handlebar grips, seat cushion, paint on the rims) are all of good quality for the cost of the bike. I do have a concern about the quality of the rear wheel hub as I'm certain that they are running a little too noisy (suggesting a lack of grease or poor quality components - listen carefully to the lower-pitched, grinding sound in the video - that sound is coming from the wheel hub, not from something rubbing against the rim or tire). I suspect that they will last at least a couple of years so I'm not too concerned about that. It may be that they are meant to be noisy, although the noisy rear hub, combined with the buckle in one of the rear wheels (see video) just makes me wonder again about the final stage of manufacturing of these bikes. OK, overall, not a bad bike for the price, but be prepared to put in some effort to ensure a safe ride for your child or grandchild.Bike size advice: My kids are both nine years old and about 54" and 52" tall, and the bikes work well for both of them. I expect that they'll get about one to two years of use out of the bikes. So the 42" - 56" recommendation, and 5 - 9 year age group seems reasonable. However, I do think (but am not certain) that the average 5 year old would be a little too small to handle this bike size. For example, I feel that the handlebars would be sitting a little too high for a typical 5 year old, and I also feel that the brake levers would be a little too difficult for a 5 year old's hands to reach comfortably. Again, I stand corrected on this. Worst case scenario, if it is too small you can always store it for later use.  I think the perfect age for this bike would be a seven year old, average-size kid, and would end up getting about 3 years of good use out of it.

He wears it for work and pretty much everywhere he goes. It has a chunky face and is a substantial watch. All the functions work, too. It's a great watch for the money.

Stylish, Rugged, and easily fits larger wrists. All the features I could want at an amazing price! My only criticism would be getting it set up is not the most intuitive process out there, hang on to the directions. It’s a little difficult to navigate the various functions the watch offers.

Took a while to figure out the day, i.e., Friday, Saturday...  Can't seem to change the date, which is off by one day.  Still testing.  UPDATE:  In less than six months the watch died.  I went to change the battery and it went downhill from there. Once I pulled the plastic from the battery to change it nothing worked.  I had purchased a fresh pack of 2025 so I know it wasn't the new battery.

It has all the usual features (stop watch, alarm, date) and it is easy to read as well as comfortable to wear. Do be aware that the watch is huge and bulky, you are not gonna win any fashion contests with this.The cons of this watch are fairly small and simple but they are significant enough to make it lose 2 stars from my rating. The first and most important issue is the manual. I tried searching for it online and it is impossible to find, if you lose it you are SOL so I have taken the trouble of taking pictures of it and putting them in this review in case some helpless soul comes to this page looking for the manual.The second issue is that the watch has this thing on its display (marked with red in the last picture) that seems to be tied to the seconds but I have no idea what it does. The manual doesn't even acknowledge its existence and frankly it takes a significant portion of the display real state.Other than it is a really good watch. The light is bright, the strap is comfy, it looks like something the Navy SEALS would wear while raiding Bin Laden.

The 1.96" HD display is crystal clear and easy to navigate, making it a delight to use. The fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, accurately monitoring my heart rate, sleep patterns, and various sports activities. I love how it reminds me to move when I've been sitting for too long and tracks my steps throughout the day. The fact that it is IP68 waterproof is a huge bonus, as I can wear it even during my swimming sessions. The ability to answer and make calls directly from the watch is incredibly convenient, and the call quality is surprisingly good. Overall, this smartwatch has exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and feature-rich wearable device.

I got this for my sister who has an android phone, it works wonders. In her case she speaks Spanish only and we were able to change the language with no issue, you are able to connect it with your phone, answer phone calls, accurately check your heart rate, track your steps and so much more. Very easy to use and the battery life is great, she is in school all day and works out too and doesn’t need to be charged till 2 days after. Size is perfect for her and looks just like Apple Watch.

It is large, colorful, has many options, a comfortable watch band, and is sleek enough that I could definitely wear it with my work clothes.  The only issue was discovered by my wife - no blood pressure reader- which is an important feature for my family.  So, until that is resolved, I have to go elsewhere.  Please resolve and I will be back.  This was an excellent smartwatch that I really wanted to keep.

It purports to measure your pulse, but I find it seriously inaccurate.  The values are all over the place, from 50 BPM to over 130 BPM.  There is no way I could have been at 130 BPM without my knowing it - I'd have been gasping for breath.  I doubt my pulse ever gets down to 50 BPM, either.  I'm just not that laid back.The manufacturer says that for greater accuracy you need to wear the watch more tightly om your wrist.  When I tried that I found that my skin couldn't breathe, which caused it to become irritated.  So the values are just going to be inaccurate.It doesn't seem to know when I go to sleep, either.  Often before I turn in, I read for a bit.  At such times I am immobile, so the watch thinks I'm sleeping.  If I have to get up to pee in the night, the watch thinks I've gotten up for 20-40 minutes or so.It purports to measure blood oxygen saturation levels, which for all I know it might be doing.  I have never found any use for that particular function.It annoyingly is connected to my phone such that when I get a call, my watch starts making a lot of noise.  I have not yet found the way to stop this.  The instructions are inadequate.  This is highly annoying, because almost every call is spam.One feature that seems to work well is its keeping track of my steps.  That's useful, and is a reminder to me to keep walking.  Once upon a time I had a pedometer that I used.  That's all it did - measure my steps.  I wanted that.  So if this watch did nothing more, I would still like it as a pedometer.Overall I am disappointed in this watch.  I probably wouldn't buy it again.  I might recommend it to someone I didn't like.

Sie sieht nicht nur schick aus, sondern fühlt sich auch hochwertig an – fast wie bei teuren Marken, nur viel erschwinglicher. Der Akku hält bei mir mehrere Tage durch, und dank der Schnellladefunktion ist sie blitzschnell wieder einsatzbereit. Besonders praktisch finde ich die Funktionen wie Gesundheits-Tracking, Benachrichtigungen und die Möglichkeit, die Zifferblätter anzupassen. Egal ob beim Sport oder zu besonderen Anlässen – sie passt einfach immer und funktioniert zuverlässig. Für mich die perfekte Kombination aus Qualität, Stil und Preis!

I wanted a watch that could monitor my heart beat. I had previously purchased a very expensive watch for around £150 but it wouldn't pick up my heart beat so I returned it. I saw this watch on offer for £23 so thought I would try it as it had some fantastic reviews. Within about 5 seconds of wearing it, it picked up my heart beat and appears to accurately monitor it throughout the day. You can set the watch to check for a low or high heart beat too, and it will buzz if either of these are reached. It also does my blood oxygen. I have been on a bit of an exercise mission so I wear my watch on my daily walks, and it accurately tracks my steps. I have connected it to the app on my phone (which is used to set up the watch and record information - which was really easy to do) so I can use my watch to read any text messages I receive as well as messages through other apps. The main watch face displays the time, date, weather, how much charge is left, number of steps, number of calories burnt, heart beat, and number of km travelled. You can also make and receive calls from the watch. You can set a workout such as cycling, walking, running etc. It can also track your sleep (which I haven't tried as I don't like sleeping with a watch on). You can use it as an audio device to play music. It has an alarm clock on it, stopwatch, timer, torch, a sytem to find your phone, a remote camera and calculator. It holds its charge really well. I am currently on day 3 after charging it and it is registering as 63% charged. I 100% recommend this watch to anyone. I'm sure there are watches out there that do far more, but it already has more functions than I will actually use, so I am more than happy with it. I also find it really easy to use and navigate.

Es cómodo, atractivo y funciona bien, con una batería de larga duración que se carga fácilmente con su cable de carga magnético. Simplemente conecte el conector USB a un cargador estándar y el otro extremo se conecto magnéticamente al reloj.El reloj tiene todas las funciones habituales, como los latidos del corazón, el oxígeno en sangre, los pasos, la fecha, el tiempo que va hacer, alarmas etc.La configuración se realizó fácilmente descargando la aplicación «GloryFit» para Android y se conectó automáticamente después de introducir mis datos personales en el teléfono.Es resistente al agua, para mí es importante, porque siempre se me olvida quitármelo para fregar o ducharme, con este reloj ese olvido no importa.Una característica interesante es que la pantalla se enciende cuando levantas el brazo si lo deseas y la hora de visualización se puede ajustar en incrementos de 5 segundos.En general, este reloj inteligente  tiene una buena relación calidad-precio.

The quality is very good. The colors are very vibrant. The battery has lasted a very, very long time. I’ll be definitely buying more.

I just love the fact that they list stop by stop where your order is. I ordered this for my son for his graduation present and was very excited to give it to him. I was able to see how many stops the driver had before he got to me which allowed me to not only have a better idea of its arrival time, but I was also able to enjoy a buildup of excitement as it got closer and closer.As for the quality of the product ~ both my son and I are very impressed and more than satisfied with the watch so far. I was very trepidatious as so many items, especially jewelry items, look stunning, gorgeous, beautiful, high quality in the pictures online and are nothing short of utterly disappointing when you get them. This watch renewed my belief that there are honest sellers out there. I will say that we just got the watch today so this is purely about the initial presentation and look of the watch.So, the packaging was super nice, high-end quality. Each piece (bands, watchface) were separately wrapped in nice, thick plastic to protect from scratching. The boxes (box for watch & slip cover outer box) were great quality (you know, so many companie's packaging falls apart at barely a touch, which makes me wonder about the quality of what's inside). Thorough, grammatically correct (mostly) directions included; also had tools for taking out links along with fairly easy to follow pictured & written directions. We did have to use a separate pin with a head (like tailors use to mark hem points) to push out the pins bcz the one included bent.One thing I really appreciate is that the company said they are there anytime and to please let them know of any issues. Usually companies do all they can to make it as hard as possible to be contacted.I couldn't stop looking at the watch! It DEFINITELY looks SO MUCH MORE expensive than it was! And the workings move like a Rolex (smoothly), not jumpy like the workings of normal watches. Even my husband remarked on how "Rolexey" it looked. I ordered the all black watch.Again, we've only just gotten it, but if the initial presentation is any indicator of its performance, WE'VE GOT A WINNER!!

It was very attractive and I hope it would work as advertised.  The watch came in shrink wrapped plastic that was very tough to removed. I feared damaging the watch.  I set it then tried some of its features.  The stopwatch worked but it did not reset to the zero position properly.  The 24 hour time indicator was off by one hour.  The rotating bezel had black lacquer on it that was tender to the touch.  A fingernail could have damaged it and a very small nick had already started out of the box.  If everything had worked properly I would have kept it for the money spent.  I guess you get what you pay for so I am now shopping for a higher quality watch.

Not only did it break my screws but it would also bend my tools even when I used one of the best watch tools. I gave up on these watches because I had such a difficult time removing the links out of the watch. I enjoyed the reflection of the light on my new watch despite it being light weight. It was a nice.

It’s automatic so there’s no need of replacing batteries or winding it each day.  I’ve had it for one week and it’s almost perfect in not losing more than a few seconds each day.  I’ve yet to adjust the time on it.  The only complaint if you can call it a complaint is sizing it to fit small wrists by removing watch band links.  Probably better to take it to a watch repair shop and have them do it for you.  But all in all…..I love this watch and highly recommend it.  And for an additional $3.99 you can get a 2 year repair service warranty.

That being said, I am pretty satisfied with it. It was super easy to set up and connect to my phone. So far it hasn't disconnected for any reason. Its pretty comfortable (I haven't worn a watch in years), easy to read the screen. It looks good, doesn't seem to big or anything like that. I like that I can set drink water reminders. It seems accurate in the health tracking as far as I can tell. I did notice the step counting does/can get a little wonky if you're shaking your arm alot. I was sitting in bed while fixing my sheets and blankets and it gave me about 50 steps, but I don't think it's that bad seeing as I personally don't typically just shake my arms. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the watch nd the price. I plan on using it permanently.

It's pink which is pretty for a girl and it was relatively inexpensive. It keeps great track of my steps and the time I exercise. It keeps track of my stress. It keeps track of my heart rate which is extremely important. I actually bought a second one so I be prepared in case the first one stopped working.

I got it mainly to track my steps and it works perfect.  It only needs charging once a week.  I am very happy with this purchase.

I did read reviews and saw that there were some issues, but didn't see anything related to this but maybe I missed it. Anyhow, the watch is as described. It does sync up with your phone easily. However it just won't connect to Alexa, I keep getting a java error. I've taken two calls through it, while the phone calls worked perfectly- I think the placement of the speaker affects the quality. Ie; can't hear sometimes while I'm moving because the speaker moves too close to my wrist and gets muffled. As this was my first foray into smartwatch territory, I don't know if this is typical placement for wrist speaker or not. The step counter seemed to be reasonably accurate, but the calorie counter was way out in left field it was so wrong. Oh, also I was disappointed that there are only 3 (very generic) watchface options. I did write a letter to customer support but have not heard back yet. I'll probably end up returning this item for a refund.

Issues began only a few days later. First, the step tracker is completely inaccurate (which is the reason I bought this in the first place). It randomly deducted 1000 steps regularly and there was no way to fix this. Second, the charger is horribly designed. It’s almost always loose which means the watch isn’t charging. Third, the watch randomly stopped working in the middle of my workout. It was fully charged btw. I was lifting so it’s not like I was in water or excessively sweating like in cardio. I tried doing a hard reset and charging it but nothing worked. That was the last straw for me.I bought this mainly to track my steps and workouts but it was not effective. I would not recommend. The call feature is alright if you care for that sort of thing.Finally, if you have a small wrist, I would not recommend. The band is very long and will most likely not fit you.

I haven't had any issue. The battery time is good. The fit on my wrist is very good. The instructions to learn to use the watch were easy to comprehend. It's a nice everyday watch to have.

When I ask Alexa to set a timer, or ask about the weather conditions it does not understand. It always losing connection. I will not recommend buying this watch as functionality is mediocre. Don't spend your money with this product. I will be returning it since it does not work as advertised

I absolutely love this little watch. It does a great job counting my steps and even telling me how well I slept.

It’s very comfortable, and the display is awesome. Big numbers. Looks like a G-Shock. If you want a watch to tell time, provide an alarm and use as a timer/stopwatch that’s easy to see, buy it. The light works fine. I have the grey with the negative display, and it’s easy to read too. Also have the tan. I wish the black and tan were available in negative display but they still look good the way they come. Great watch..great price..great battery life. Pick a color and buy it.
## 56  I have used my cell phone instead of a watch since about 2001.  Decided to start wearing cheap, quartz watches again because I often find myself without my cell phone within reach at rehearsals, recording sessions, lawn-mowing, or work from home situations. Picked up a few Timexes and Casios around the same time. So far, I like this model the best for general use. The size of the time display is so easy to read that I have already started preferring it to comparable analog models.  I will mostly be looking to buy digital watches like this with big, simple displays from now on.I’m not James Bond, in spite of what you may have heard. I don’t want an expensive watch on my wrist that might make me a potential target for theft/robbery downtown or on a subway. If I get some paint on this one or it breaks while I’m trying to remove an oil filter, it would be no great loss.Use is fairly intuitive and it hasn’t lost or gained time in the few weeks I’ve owned it, unlike a Timex expedition analog model I got at the same time. After only a couple of weeks, the analog Timex expedition has lost about ten seconds already, which I admit I was surprised by.The only complaint I could possibly make about this watch is that the two LED’s are quite poor in comparison to Timex’s indiglo or the backlight used on much more expensive G-Shock models. But for how cheap and functional this model is, that is a completely unfair comparison. The lights work perfectly fine for me to see if I wake up in the middle of the night but can’t roll/reach over to check my phone due to a sleeping dog contorting my legs at the foot of the bed. Or if I fall asleep on the couch.I have mostly avoided getting it wet up until now, but I did accidentally leave it in the bathroom with the shower running a couple of times and no condensation formed on the inside of the face at all even though there was plenty of water vapor in the room. I also leave it on when washing my hands with no ill-effects.I’m very impressed by how simple and functional this watch is. These cheap, digitals are light years ahead of the Timex Ironman I owned as a kid. But it should be said- that $25-$35 Ironman I bought sometime around 1995 went body boarding, surfing, in the pool with me, and I showered with it on. That thing was basically water-PROOF and never had an issue in water less than 20ft. deep. I swam in Atlantic/East-Coast hurricanes with that thing and it even got tossed around in the salty surf with me. Also used it to time lap-swimming in Olympic-sized pools. I do not have the same confidence in this model, though I have no real rationale for that.The rubber strap was very uncomfortable on the old Ironman models and used to cause some really annoying, visible, skin irritation. I found G-shock straps of that era to be almost just as bad. That is not the case with these modern Casio polymer straps.I also despise those weird circles Casio, Armitron, etc. put on watch faces and take up a quarter of the face of the watch. This watch has NONE of that BS going on. The info on the watch face is SO bold and easy to read that I would definitely prefer it to all the G-shocks with those damned, senseless circles taking up so much of the display. PV cells excluded because they actually do serve a purpose. But here’s my view on all that: if the watch battery lasts even close to ten years, it will already outlast the battery/operation of the solar-powered, $150 G-Shock I once owned by a factor of YEARS. So I would still prefer this because legibility is far more important to me than photovoltaics.After a few weeks getting used to wearing a watch again for the first time in twenty years, I’ve really appreciated not having to dig my cell phone out of my pocket just to check the time/date. A weirdly subtle difference I would never have thought would matter.  But it does. I’m starting to really like Casios!I also like the hourly chime because otherwise I get lost and completely lose track of time while recording/producing. That could only backfire if the chime goes off in the vocal booth and ruins a take. Hasn’t happened yet, though.I’m also glad they make it in the desert-sand/beige color because I’m fair skinned so it doesn’t look like a giant thing on my wrist.At some point or other I will wake up exhausted and forget to take it off before I get in the shower. At that point I will update this review if water penetrates the buttons/gaskets/seals.Again, I am in disbelief at how excellent this watch is for the price. I hope they never discontinue this model until an identical “20 Year Battery” model is available.  But by then we’ll no doubt have flying cars, rocket-skates, jet packs, and digital, tattooed watches with veinous, indiglo epidermis.  Or more than the current, standard-issue, two to three computer chips implanted into in our visual cortex at birth.Just pick the color you like and buy the damned thing!

I have an Apple Watch and another stainless steel “dress” watch.I wanted a watch I could wear when working out, or doing something physical that wasn’t going to buzz at me every 8 seconds and tell me what a good boy I was for taking 5 steps and remind me to breathe.Also, I think Apple Watches are great, but they’re a little bloated with useless features that, at the end of the day, I’ve never really used.I wanted something simple, easy to read, and able to take a beating. I wanted basic tactical features (like dual time zones, stop watch, alarms, timer, a clear second display, a light)This watch is easily comparable to the “G-Shock”.Not only does it do everything I want it to do, it looks incredible. It’s very stylish. Very clear, easy to read display at a glance and it fits great (I’m a guy, 5’7” with a small wrist circumference and got the “standard” size)I’ve tested the display light in the dark and it works great. Easily readable.Build quality seems excellent. Seems to be sturdy and durable. Doesn’t feel or look cheap by any means.Haven’t tested the water resistance yet but I don’t doubt it’s going to be fine.And finally, the price. The price is unbelievable for what you get. For the $20-25 price point you get way more features and value than you’d expect.Highly recommend!

I like it, very basic. Very nice for the money I paid, good value. It seems scratch resistant and durable, and the time is pretty accurate too.One con: it did take some YouTube videos to make the alarms stop (I bought a used one and it came with alarms). But over very nice, basic, I’m glad I bought it. Also, I like the backlight. It’s the first watch I got with this kind of backlight. It’s easy to use the timer, stopwatch, and whatever. It comes with alarms, and even a time setting for a different time zone! That’s new, I never had a watch like that. Overall, I like it

Very nice looking, easy to read, and comfortable. Love the dial, like the white background, and even the brown Band is nice and soft and comfortable. Looks like the crystal is very well made too! Scratch resistant. I have another fossil in a different model and it's been excellent for over 10 years now. They are accurate, and look more high-line and expensive than they are. Great size and functionality, has glow in darkness feature.

Several people have commented very favorably about its looks for the same reason I was drawn to it: classic looking watch, not flashy/ostentatious. If I lose or break it, or the watch stops working, I'll likely be looking for this model again.

From its classic design to its impressive functionality, this watch is truly a standout piece.The first thing that caught my eye was the stunning dial, which adds a unique and stylish touch to the traditional Grant design. It’s the perfect balance of elegance and modernity, making it suitable for any occasion.The chronograph display not only adds a practical element to the watch but also gives it a sporty edge that my significant other loves. Whether he’s timing laps at the track or simply keeping track of the time during a busy day, the chronograph feature comes in handy.The quality of the watch is evident in every detail, from the durable stainless steel case to the comfortable blue leather strap. It feels substantial on the wrist without being too heavy, and the craftsmanship is top-notch.But perhaps the best part of all is seeing the smile on my significant other’s face whenever he wears this watch. It’s clear that he truly loves it, and that’s the best endorsement I could ask for.Overall, I highly recommend the Fossil Grant Men’s watch to anyone in search of a stylish and reliable timepiece. Whether you’re buying it for yourself or as a gift for someone special, you can’t go wrong with this beautiful watch.

Pretty versatile, could wear semi-casual with a button up shirt, to business formal with a suit. Nothing too fancy, but decent quality for the sale price. I paid $65 for the black band and bought another one with the brown band for $75. Fair prices, I wouldn’t pay more for that with this one. And they are different enough that it’s not the exact same watch with different bands either, the dial is not the same between the different variations, which is goodOnly drawback is it’s a little boring, but boring isn’t always bad. If you don’t want your watch to domineer your outfit and you’re not necessarily trying to make a bold statement or stand out all that much this is a nice one.

It's got a nice weight, the color scheme (especially the orange second hand) is gorgeous.  The case is a brushed grey, a little lighter than gunmetal.  Simple and sleek! Can't remember the last time I had a watch with indiglo - love that! The watch brand seems like a decent quality leather band - it does take time to break in though, which I'd expect will lend to durability long term.Only minor downside is the lume on the hour/min hands is pretty weak.  But doesn't seem all that necessary when you have the indiglo lighting up the dial in low light.Time and Date setting was a breeze - pretty standard for anything with a crown.

In a world where there are clocks on our phones, our tablets, our laptops and computers I asked myself why do I need a watch? I pretty much summed it up as this. Wearing a watch is a classy, manly thing and I really did miss wearing a watch everyday.  So let's start again with a new watch. Besides, I now don't find myself digging in my pocket for my phone when someone asks me what time is it or when I need to look to see if my if I am running on time to a secret meeting with another covert operative for beers.This Timex has a classic design, with a rugged looking band that appears to be easily replaced down the road. I've only had it less than a week. But it feels like I have been wearing it for much longer than 5 days. I barely notice this on my wrist until I see it peeking out from my shirt sleeve or when I need to check the time. It has a solid feel to it but it doesn't feel heavy or cumbersome. I used to have a bad habit of catching watches on door frames while walking through doorways but I have yet to have this issue with this watch. Perhaps that might change when short sleeve weather comes around?The canvas style band is something new to me and I will have to get used to latching it. With one hole the band is too loose on my wrist and the next hole the band is almost too tight. I do not fault the watch for that small issue. After all, we are all built differently. Will the band stretch in time like my previous watches with leather bands or will it retain its current size? Perhaps in a few weeks or months I will know the answer to that question. As far as looks are concerned it has a classic military look and a rugged feel but by no means does it look like I'm trying to be tacticool. It is classic enough to be worn in the office, casually or in the park or at the beach. You could probably dress this up with a nice leather band for more formal office occasions or situations. But that is just a guess. It was instantly noticed by a few guys at work the first day I wore it into the office. Could it be that they are used to seeing me without a watch or just that it had a nice appeal to it? My wife likes the way it looks on me too. In other words, she didn't dismiss it as some trendy accessory and had nice things to say about the price.What about the Indiglo? Well in the dark it is easily readable. In somewhat dim light the hands seem to reflect enough light they they blend into the background and can be hard to see. But it is easier read without the indiglo in those situations. I really like the yellow seconds hand too. not too bright and just subtle enough to stick out of the black background. Does it keep accurate time? Since I set it after opening the box it appears to keep accurate time. It matches time with my Citizen, Fossil watches as well as my iPhone. If it loses any time I have yet to notice.What about the loud ticking? I don't hear it unless I put the watch up to my ear then it makes an audible tick. I have yet to hear it sitting on the nightstand next to my bed or even while wearing it. I have yet to get it wet, sweaty, dirty or banged up. But give me time, it will happen, I assure you. We will see if it stands up to regular daily use after I give it a thorough going over. I think with the classic styling of this watch it will look just as good with nicks and scratches as it does brand new. I am sure to add pictures and a follow up review down the road. I really like this watch and hope it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

I found the strap comfortable and enjoy the simple design of the dial. The activatable backlight illuminates the whole dial surface (so you don't have to rely on lume plots) and is very readable in the dark. I was solidly satisfied with this purchase at first.However, 1 major downside to this watch is that the movement inside is LOUD. In a quiet room, you can absolutely hear the watch ticking on your wrist. You can even hear the watch ticking across a reasonably sized room if it's quiet, such as on your bedroom dresser at night. I found how audible the ticks are to be annoying enough where it detracts from the wearing experience.As my return window has passed, I will keep the watch as a "beater" watch for doing things like yard work or hiking. To be fair, the audible ticks are not noticeable during most daily activities, like going for a walk, going to the supermarket, etc. You need to be in a quiet room/location for the ticks to be noticeable. However, when I'm sitting down to read a book, or have a quiet conversation at home with a friend, I do not want my watch to be so audible that it's distracting or annoying.If it wasn't for the audible ticking of the watch, I'd give the watch 5 stars, especially considering its affordable price. However, I have to subtract at least 1 star because of the audible tick.

I have numerous watches from the best down to the average and Timex holds up as good as the best, especially the solar powered expeditions. They always look great and have a comfortable band, easy to read and it looks like a high end watch!!  Whats not to like??

Reasonable size, not too heavy (for a man), easy to read, somewhat simple utilitarian stylish and has a lighted dial with a push of the watch stem. Getting the time easily in dim light is a real bonus, without dragging out your cell phone. Timex watches are tried and true. One thing I don't like - it seems impossible to get a similar watch with a durable hardened glass crystal vs a hard plastic as this watch - they scratch up in time with someone engaged in heavy working. But to get this feature, watches are usually divers style, heavy, complex to read, large and very expensive. So with this watch, its a super value and I am quite happy.

Tiene un movimiento de cuarzo muy bueno y fiable, con un segundero que atina a todos los marcadores de segundos. La correa es buena y se siente de calidad. En general soy muy fan de los Eco-Drive de Citizen que también son solares, sin embargo su precio más barato es quizá más del doble de lo que cuesta este Timex. Por su precio considero que es una excelente opción

My boyfriend had to take out a couple links to make it fit. It's also easy to bump the button that changes time so he accidentally changes the time on it often. Aside from that it's a very nice classy watch. Great for dressing up.

It is tough, highly water resistant, easy to read, lightweight, and keeps excellent time. I am an aircraft mechanic that collects watches - some of them quite expensive, but this is what I wear to work. If it happens to get damaged (unlikely), it is inexpensive to replace. It isn't fancy but it gets the job done at an excellent price. It is of great quality for its purpose, which is not to be a fashion accessory or wrist computer but to tell you the time and date. A crazy concept, I know.

But then it decided to switch to military time (24-hour format), and suddenly I had to learn how to read it. I didn’t sign up for a math lesson when I bought this!After a crash course in figuring out what “14:00” means, (it’s 2:00 btw) I can now say I’m smarter because of this watch. Still, a heads-up would’ve been nice. 5/5. Because I guess it’s good to hear something once in a while..

I would say that one issue with the white band is that it does discolor over time a bit.

Yes, I’m the type of person who likes to know what time it is in the shower. I read the instruction manual and it says not to turn the light on while under water. I have made sure to follow that tip and so far, the watch is as good as new after daily use for several months. The only thing I’ve noticed is that the words “Illumination” and “Water resistant” have faded a bit on the outer shell. Highly recommend this watch if you want something effective, durable, and don’t need smart features. I had a Fitbit (now dead), but now that I know my sleep patterns are fine, I no longer see a need to replace it with another Fitbit.

In fact I purchased this over the other casio watch Casio Men's MQ24-1E Black Resin Watch because those reviewers complained about the watch having too small of a face and band. Well, this watch I found has the same issue for me. I am an average guy; 5'8", 190lbs, do a lot of physical work but not buff. I do not have "cankles" for wrists (or would you call them "wrankles"?). Anyway, point is, just an average male. I bought this watch because honestly, "watch stink" from keeping my watch on my wrist 24/7 literally ruined my favorite watch (no replacement bands available for the unique design of the watch face). I had to go through two of these expensive watches to learn what the heck "watch stink" even was. But I was not going to throw down a lot of money on yet another of these watches. However being watchless was driving me absolutely crazy! My watch was more important that even having my iPhone on me! So I just caved in and ordered this guy. It was a couple bucks cheaper than the casio black analogue sister watch (link above). I love/hate this watch.In short I do not like this watch for the following reasons: the watch face is slightly small (just a tad), the band is not long enough and is veryyy thin. But I KNEW this before purchasing - I'm only saying it again for emphasize to guys out there. I also do not like paper thin watch bands. I like that thick rubber or nylon feeling. The thin resin strap is cost-effective and does its job, but it's so thin and flimsy I am always tempted to rip it off my wrist at least once a day. The length of the strap is not very long either. So the buckle ends up being almost on the side of my wrist instead of under it, like it should be. I'm at the 3rd/4th to last hole. The watch in person does not look professional.But the resin strap is really the only thing that reallllly bugs me. Aside from that I appreciate that Casio made this watch practical and useful despite its price. There are a lot of junk watches out there at the same price range. These watches will have their finishes peel off, scratch easily and will not be water resistant. They will perform as cheaply as they are made. This watch surprisingly differs in that regard. It's accurate with time, simple simple simple (love that part). And is water resistant up to 50M (just make sure the screw dial pin is pushed all the way in!). The watch face is simple, sleek, and easy to read. No funky numbers, small numbers or other distractions on the face. As much as I want to call this the perfect "beater watch," when I think of beater watch I think of something that's extremely durable under abuse and will last- not so much the other line of thought "I'll just toss it if it breaks and not cry over spilt milk." I don't like throwing things away or using things that are prone to being disposed of early on. So while I want to use this watch for my dirty tasks like work around the house, while working on my car, working with animals, etc. I do not get the feeling that this watch will stand to much abuse. I will test it out though and confirm in an update when/if this watch breaks.If there was a $20 version of this watch - one that had a longer, thicker strap, slightly bigger watch face, and the inclusion of a small date window - I would buy it in a heartbeat! For about $8 though, if you are skinny/have really narrow wrists this is perfect! Also want to mention this is not a gender-specific watch. It's truly universal. Just because it fits on narrow wrists, don't let that fool you. Both guys and gals have thin and thick wrists. This watch is ideal for the narrow-wristed folks out there. Enjoy!

Extremely light on the wrist; you hardly know it's there. No date feature, no luminous hands, just yer basic watch. Keeps perfect time. The description mentions a mineral glass crystal...nope. It's plastic, too.At 15 bucks what's not to like?

The band is more like a semi stiff plastic. I thought it was going to be soft like silicone bands. The little strap you tuck the excess band into pinched my arm once,  and to have the band tight enough to not keep shifting watch around my wrist isn't comfortable. I  ordered a few elastic replacement bands. I got the wrong size because it listed the width of band as 20mm. But the size you need to make it fit is 16mm. The band pins on this casio's band connectionis kind of hard to open. I used a paper clip to push the spring pin in (hard to get it to go) , and pull the band off at same time. The pin things on this are just straight.  Others I've used, including the replacement/ replacement bands I'm using have a kind of knobby thing attached that you can use to push in the spring activated pin. Much simpler. The elastic replacement band looks better than original and is way more comfortable.So, to sum up... watch itself if is great. It did come with battery already operating,  so I hope battery lasts a while, but no biggie.  While the actual watch is easy to read and the perfect size, the band that included is not great. A replacement elastic band (with 16mm size connection) makes the watch a 5/5. If it had been more expensive I would've been annoyed at having to get hew bands. But it's cheap and with new band it doesn't look cheap. So far its keeping time accurately. I also like that it's water resistant. The only negative I've found is the sub-par band, but new one can be gotten really cheap.Nice basic analog watch with a second hand, at a low price.

I`m a retired senior with alot of health issues right now and I don`t have alot of money to pay for a new watch after paying all my health bills. I`m one human being who doesn`t like purchasing batteries when my watch stops working because alot of times I need to also replace the band so I rather like to purchase a new watch. The price of this watch fit into my budget very nicely so I was able to purchase two of them to switch off.

It's a great value for the money, and it's perfect for my needs.The mouse pad is very large, which gives me plenty of room to move my mouse around. This is especially important for gaming, but it's also nice to have a lot of space for general use. The mouse pad is also very comfortable, and it provides a smooth gliding surface for my mouse.Another great thing about the Amazon Basics mouse pad is that it's very durable. I've been using it for several months now, and it still looks and feels new. It's also very easy to clean.

Pretty simple mouse pad and durable. I really like the size as I tend to not like small regular size ones. This allows me to have more freedom with the mouse without running off the pad.  I do music and larger pads are needed so I can adjust multiple parameters and knobs in my digital audio workstation.  PERFECT MOUSE PAD for music creators!  Highly recommended.  Thank you Amazon Basics! :)

I have to have my keyboard sitting partially on the pad because it's so big!Feels great to work on and it's thin too.

Ojo con el tamaño, puede ser demasiado grande para escritorios estándar y uno tendría que poner el monitor de la computadora encima del pad, pero si se tiene en cuenta esto, es un muy buen producto. Tengo con él apenas unos 6 meses pero se nota que va a durar mucho tiempo; muy buenos materiales. Es grande y pesado por lo que no es portátil como para llevarlo a todos lados, pero cumple al 100 en lugares de trabajo fijos

Firm gel wrist support. Mousepad itself is a little smaller than what I have used in the past but it's absolutely fine. I'm not slopping the mouse around anyway. I'm not going to say it's the Max Verstappen of ergo mousepads but it's perfectly reasonable, economical little thing. 5/5, would probably buy again but chances are this brand will be gone from Amazon before I wear it out.

I like the fact that it adheres to my desk and does not move around while I am working.

The wrist rest is too small.  This might be ok for a child with a mini sized mouse, but not for any adult with a normal size mouse.  The mouse pad size is purposely not mentioned in all of the detailed descriptions provided nor in the title.The sides of the mouse pad are already curling.  So not only is it small, now I have side ramps!I've only had this for about 20 days.  Return initiated.  Buyer beware!

The old pad was larger and had a more substantial wrist rest that I really liked.  This pad has a very small wrist rest that doesn't offer much support.  Not worth returning for the small price I paid, but my recommendation is to buy some other pad.

Non slip works well

Compared to my old bulky mouse pad with the leaking gel wrist rest support, this one is shaped ergonomically with a smaller but very adequate wrist rest support that allows my wrist to pivot more effectively to move the mouse efficiently. I love the non-slip, smaller profile base. The cloth surface of the mouse pad is smooth with a very attractive graphic design that suits me to a 'T'. The two-pack pads accommodate two office locations and have now become a sort of 'signature' of my office spaces. Great quality, perfect price point, tremendous value -- I highly recommend.

Don't think it will last forever though.  Both of these ended up coming apart.  The wrist rests end up coming apart so that the gel starts coming out and begins sticking to your wrist. They lasted about a year and a half overall before the bottom of the wrist rest came apart.

This pad did not get daily use - only average of about an hour or so a week total.  I will be spending the extra money for a larger better quality mouse pad.

Bright colors like the photo shows and doesn't slip on my desk.  Would buy again.

As you can see, my wrist lays in a straight line which has been alleviating my wrist pain since this is the first ergonomic mouse pad I have ever purchased. The cooling gel is no joke, either. Every time my wrist lays on it, its nice and cool to the touch, a very soft gel-like feel.The design options are super cute also, and don't look to be low quality at all.The no-slip grip on the bottom has been working out quite well as this mouse pad STAYS IN PLACE! It's actually a matter of having to pick up the whole thing and move it when necessary as it seriously doesn't go anywhere.My only concern for this product would be the future of the no-slip bottom since I would anticipate the material on the bottom picking up dust and dirt over time, but i'm sure this could be fixed with some spot cleaning and really is not a deal-breaker for the aesthetic and ergonomic aspects this product offers.Overall, a very good mousepad for not a ton of money and one I highly reccomend!

It has excellent quality, and unlike other mouse pads I've had, it is nice and grippy so it stays put. Most importantly, it tracks my mouse perfectly! My mouse was sometimes not receiving inputs due to a lack of mouse pad, previous mouse pads also would have mistracks. The material is smooth and glidey. I love the size!

From a performance standpoint, it is basically exactly how I want my mousepad for a tac shooter. There is very little startup friction in spite of the decently controlled dynamic friction/glide, which makes this pad very easy to flick while still being able to microadjust. It's a very confident pad in terms of aim, but there are some downsides I should note.There are a few problems with the material. Namely, it has a very distinct odor. This is the mold release that is used to cast the rubber base. It actually left a residual coat on my desk that I had to wipe off after removing the pad. The actual surface however is decently smooth and free of imperfections, time will tell how well it holds up.The pad would be very ergonomic if not for the raised stitching. The stitching sits a good mm over the rest of the mousepad, so it digs into your arm and causes quite a bit of irritation. I have to leave this pad over the edge so that the stitching doesn't keep scratching my arm. Aside from a comfort standpoint, the stitching also interferes with the mouse when you graze the edge. With other mousepads, the stitching is low enough that your mouse will still glide fine until you practically run it off the pad. This translates to a larger usable area on the mousepad.I actually think the standard QCK is a better purchase due to the lack of raised stitching alone. Yes, it won't last as long as the QCK Edge, but you get a more comfortable mousepad with a larger usable area.

Yo no necesito tanto, así que compré el mediano, y entiendo porqué es el más popular. El agarre es casi perfecto, la textura es cómoda, y al no ser rígido es fácil de ponerlo donde sea. Obvio, sólo funciona si lo pones en superficies sólidas. Pero definitivamente, no veo la necesidad de comprar un mousepad más caro. Si los gamers profesionales utilizan este mismo (o generalmente la versión grande), es porque efectivamente no necesitas más. Llevo mucho con el mousepad y ni siquiera muestra signos de algún daño o desgaste. Único inconveniente es que es fácil de que se ensucie, así que al menos un día hay que limpiarlo para que esté en perfecto estado. Excelente para gamers ocasionales que no necesitan el grande.

I recently put contact paper on my desk to liven it up a bit, but realized my mouse would NOT glide properly on it. I found this mousepad and I appreciated the look, support, and price. When it arrived, I didn’t notice a strong smell at all; it smells like what I imagine a mousepad is to smell like haha. I really like the ergonomic support, the size, and the softness of the pad, and it works really well for my mouse! One of the main reasons why I don’t like many mousepads is the backing. This one has an excellent grip; it’s almost like it’s glued down to my desk, so there is no slipping, just be sure to remove the protective plastic on the back.

The anti slip grip underneath is damn near glue but in a good way. It’s nice and wide, feels comfortable but not too soft. Not sure why you would need anything else if this is the style you’re looking for.

Mine is about a year old now and just starting to show signs of wear in the center.

This is a good value for the money. It's basic and all you do is put it by your computer. Tracking is perfect. It is very smooth. There is very little noise, which means you can work in a recording studio with this. It is very functional with the wrist rest protector.

The gel is comfortable and the fabric is easily cleaned off. I would recommend for a mouse pad with gel wrist rest.

The black shows everything as anyone who has ever had a black mouse pad knows, but that is my only and very picky criticism. For the price they are basically disposable. As soon as one starts to show any signs of aging you can just throw it away and pull out a new one. Good purchase.

I'm using it with a wireless mouse and my mouse glides smoothly across its surface, where it was difficult to move before. My only issue with it is it doesn't always stay in place during extensive use, it can be easy to accidentally move with the palm of my hand. But it's hard to complain for $5, and having 2 extras is nice for when this one eventually wears down.

My mouse glides over it perfectly and without any stutter or excess movement, and my keyboard doesn't move at all; plus, it's got my favorite piece of artwork on it. Absolutely worth it -- it might be budget priced, but it doesn't look or feel like it's a budget option.

It helps to keep his keyboard from sliding around while he plays. Great product for the price! Good quality!

Too big for most keyboard trays though, so once I installed a keyboard tray I mostly just use it as a desk blotter. Keeps the pens from rolling too far, etc. and still looks really nice.

The color does not match the "olive green" in the description of the shade of green I chose. The one depicted on Amazon is darker. It is kind of like the towel the mouse pad is next to in my photo. Two different colors! Otherwise, the mouse pad feels good under my wrist and mouse slides easily.

I looked for one similar to my current mouse pad. Then I saw some recommended like this. I thought they looked ridiculous and nowhere near as comfortable as others.I ordered it. When it arrived, I was surprised the colors/image matched the photos on the website. I put it into use that day, and pleasantly discovered it was way more comfortable than the ones with just a wrist bump.

Because I am sitting considerably lower than most desk chair/desk situations, I needed something to take the pressure off the heal of my hand, which gets really sore after a day of writing. This thing has ample padding for that... and the difference in densities due to the slope makes it really versitile when I need to adjust into a different position. Can't wait to try it out in a "normal" setting, but it looks like the high point will comfortably hit the small of my wrist.Also, aesthetically, it looks great with the Logitech Lift ergonomic mouse.

It's larger than I expected but in a good wayI want to get a couple for work it's honestly that much better of the wrist rest design. Great quality and not hard or too spongy, it's what you'd want without the worry of a gel popping and mishaping ruining the whole thing. I prefer this type for sure.

Contrast is surprisingly good for an IPS display (the black areas look black), colors are very poppy, and the 5:3 aspect ratio means you're not losing much space on either 16:9 or 4:3 content.For retro games, let's talk about the processor. It has a Mali G57 MC2, 2 Cortex A78 cores, and 6 Cortex A55 cores. Anyone who keeps up with Android hardware will know this is a bizarre setup. The Mali G57 MC2 and Cortex A55s are all modest, cheap, power-sipping technology. While the Cortex A78s are freakishly fast for this price point.But I'm certain Amazon did this on purpose, and it's responsible for the great battery life, which is essential for what is basically a media consumption tablet. The modest GPU and high number of "little" cores keep battery drain minimal (this is a 5w chip, in a tablet, where 7-10w chips are the norm) while 2 A78s give it some serious oomph for the right sorts of tasks.This accidentally makes this little tablet a retro gaming powerhouse, as that relies heavily on single-core performance, with the GPU and secondary cores being an afterthought.So, it's a tablet that just excels at anything where you'll be using the screen a lot. Reading, movies, old games, etc. It may struggle with native Android games due to the weaker GPU, but compared to retro games there aren't a lot of worthwhile Android games anyway IMO.The keyboard and stylus are also very well executed.I'm typing this review on the keyboard case, and the keys are a nice size thanks to the TKL form factor, with short travel and a nice tactile, springy feel. The trackpad is small, but accurate and doesn't "lose" my finger.The stylus itself uses a user-replaceable AAAA battery. I like this decision, because small Li-po batteries wear out fast, and the AAAA means that the stylus has a super long life without worrying about whether you'll be able to find a replacement in a few years. The stylus is also magnetic and clips to the side of the tablet.The stylus is pretty accurate. I don't notice much parallax or judder. My Galaxy Tab S8 actually had slightly more parallax. However, there is more input lag than you'll get with something like a Galaxy Tab S8 or iPad with Apple Pencil. It's a quite noticeable amount of input lag compared to those two. I will mention, this tablet is about 1/3 the price of those devices and actually has a longer battery life. So it's still better than you expect for the price. But will definitely be more of an "entry level" art tablet instead of something outstanding.All in all, I still think you're getting a lot more for your money with this tablet than the others available. Amazon's reach with e-readers, with keyboards, with stylus peripherals, with tablets, and their resources and supply chain (ie, being able to order unusual tablet SoCs) has definitely given the Kindle Fire 11 a wider spread of abilities and better quality than your ordinary budget tablet. I can't really name anything I'd expect to be better for the price.The only real flaw is software; since Google Play is not preloaded and Amazon is not putting a lot of effort into their own App store, be prepared to sideload some apps if you want to use the broader spectrum of abilities this tablet has.

To put into context my love of the Fire Tablet, I’ve owned (or bought and returned) the following over the past 11 years:Fire 7 (2012/2014/2020),Fire HDX 7 (2014),Fire HD 8 (2018),Fire HD 8+ (2020/2022),Fire HD 10 (2018, 2019),Fire HD 10+ (2021),Fire Max 11 (2023).Of those, the ones I kept or kept the longest was the Fire HDX 7, the Fire 7 (2014), and the Fire HD 10 (2018).Specs for the Fire Max 11 can be found within the product description.Design and BuildThe Max 11 boasts a sleek and modern design, coupled with a build quality that feels robust and premium. Its lightweight aluminum structure makes it convenient for both work and leisure, allowing easy handling and portability. I like that it went back to a similar size/ratio of the 2018 HD 10.PerformanceEquipped with a more powerful processor than its predecessor, the Max 11 is capable of handling various tasks smoothly. Whether I am browsing the web, watching videos, or using multiple apps simultaneously, the experience is fluid and lag-free, especially compared to my HD 10.While not ‘blazingly fast’, it IS much faster than I expected.  Out of curiousity, I wound up trying it with a bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo, and for the first time-I feel this is a possible viable laptop replacement for light to medium users.  My HD 10 does not make a viable laptop replacement.  Great multitasking ability, can run enough apps at once with little to no lag.The speakers are merely adequate, if not a tad disappointing.  Thought normally I either use ear buds or a bluetooth speaker.  I don't miss having a head phone jack, and love having the quite responsive finger print sensor on the power button.DisplayThis has been probably my biggest surprise.  The display is vibrant and crisp, offering excellent viewing angles. It renders colors accurately, making it a joy to use for both media consumption and reading.  I do wish it was a TAD brighter at times, but the vibrancy of the colors makes up for it most of the time.  I’d wondered how much of a viewing difference going from the 10 to the 11 would be, and it’s shockingly a pretty big difference.  The Max 11 almost feels like a small tv, or laptop screen at times.Battery LifeBattery life has been good.  It’s not the best nor the worst, and should be more than adequate for most users.  Since I have chargers adjacent to most places I use the tablet in my house, I’ve also not needed to run it low.ValueOne of the reasons I’ve had so many Fire tablets (I’ve owned only one other non Fire tablet, a 6th gen iPad mini that I use for my business) is that I love the value proposition and ease of use.  Reviewers like to talk down the Fire software, but I have never minded it.  I am admittedly deep into the Amazon ecosystem with movies, books, music, etc., so the operating system has always made it easy to access and use that stuff.  I have also side loaded the Play store (I did this on my HD 10 also), so I have access to almost the entire Play store of apps on my Max 11.  If one is really ambitious, you can essentially turn it into more an Android operating system.  Personally, I have never like the tablet OS offered from iPad or Android tablets.  When the Fire Max 11 was first announced, I was excited about the specs, but hesitant on the price.  So I waited until Prime Day to buy it, also taking advantage of the trade in offer.  In terms of what I paid ($229-$30 trade in gift card-$46 trade in 25% off-$80 prime day offer=$73.99), of course it’s an awesome value.  At $229…I would suggest either going refurbished if available or just waiting it out for the inevitable discounts (at the time I write this, it’s on sale for $189.99).  But I still think it’s a great tablet at $229, and wouldn’t fault anyone that pays that.OverallIn conclusion, the Fire Max 11 strikes a balance between aesthetics and functionality, offering a modern solution that should meet the needs of most while offering value and longevity. It might be a worthy addition to your tech arsenal, promising reliability and efficiency in daily use.Rating: 4.5/5

Couldn't even tell that it was refurbished. It's very easy to use I've owned a few smaller Kindles and I bought a large one like this a year ago and I took it with me on a trip to my mom's house and showed it to her she had a easy time learning how to use it and play games on it so I ended up letting her keep it. I got this one to replace mine and I love it. Very easy to use to stream Netflix, Disney plus etc on, has a good selection of games on the app store with most being free or cheap but the main reason I bought it is to read books on and comics from comicology. I would highly recommend

I’m a solo musician and a side man for others including some large concerts. I researched some programs and tablets that would suit my needs. I find this 10” tablet to be just the ticket. I read a few complaints that it was slow. I find it plenty fast, easy to transfer files from a PC, the sound is pretty good using Bluetooth but better hard wired, no gaps or drop outs in the sound. It’s big enough to read set lists and lyrics at five or six feet. I have also used it for sheet music on occasion with success. All in all a great product and a bargain.

The first one was not functioning properly so I was able to return it and receive a second one from that point up until now the beginning of 2024 the experience has been subpar. Though I have an SD card for additional storage the ram just isn't there and once you start trying to maneuver your apps it starts to slow down tremendously. I did a factory reset at one point and reinstalled specific items and yet the screen would turn on and off, would not basically listen to commands?I called Amazon and told him what the problem was and that I have been an Amazon customer for many many years as most of you probably are, they were not willing to accept the return I do understand however I keep my items and pristine condition so they allowed for a replacement. I mailed back my tablet and it's original box and all content, they sent me a refurbished one which I was a little concerned about. Upon startup I realized that I'm completely ad free which is great! And it seems to me running very smooth so I have to say that the refurbished item seems to be working better than the initial two new ones.This won't be used for anything heavy like gaming, doing a lot of video content, never was intended for that use but it is now a secondary tablet which allows a family member to utilize on their own.I would recommend the Amazon tablets if you want something entry and you're not concerned about running out of storage you can put your own MicroSD in there and I think that it's a good value for the money.Update: 4.8.24I've been using this tablet since I received the refurbished one from amazon. And today this is only going to be a secondary used tablet for the primary reason of its slow running ability! It takes forever to load an app that is pre-installed and if you're wanting to get battery life out of this I would say it's average sometimes below average. I have owned Amazon products for many years but I feel as though they are still not in line with other tablets that are more mainstream. So, I would not engage and purchasing any further Amazon tablets because I just feel that the memory, ram, general build quality is just subpar at best.

The battery life is impressive, lasting all day on a single charge, so I can work or relax without worrying about finding an outlet. I also appreciate the smooth performance for basic tasks, thanks to its efficient processing power.

Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.

I initially ran into the same problem . It turned out that it was first run under Win 11 S Mode. The S mode uses up all the memory that’s why it’s slow af. Just exit S mode once you're done with initial configuration and desktop is loaded. (Try googling how to exit S mode on your phone or on a different computer and follow the instructions there)

Remove the extra cable since we all have the connector box and the computer already has a slot to connect devices.Put in the corresponding power supply cable, that's important!Muy bien la compu por fuera, pero como pruebo su sistema cuando no trae el cable de alimentación para este tipo de computadora?? Quite le el extra ya que la cajita de conectores lo tenemos todos y la compu ya trae ranura para conectar dispositivos.Pónganlo el cable alimentador de energía que corresponde que eso si es importante!

There is an error message ever since I opened it that says “Boot Device Not Found. Please install an operating system on your hard disk”. The laptop was already slow to begin with which is why I barely used it. If I had known I never would have purchased them. What a waste of money.

Still in hindsight I wish I’d spent a bit more money and purchased a faster product.

Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.

Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k.

The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows.

It has more memory than you will ever use for these purposes. But it is inexpensive and doesn't have the great video and sound cards that you need for gaming. Its a decent personal computer. Would recommend.

Computer takes a few minutes to set up, but they all do. Works find & is fast. Only thing & this is my fault for not doing enough research, it has a 15" screen which for me is a little small. I would have no problem buying this brand again just I would look for a larger screen. Nice computer!

I looked at several "higher" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only "missing" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true "lap" top.Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE.

(guarantee  up April ) i get a message to put in a recovery stick. there is no recovery stick with it so you have to make your own. first you need a computer with microsoft on it. if i had that i wouldn't have needed to buy a chromebook. what a waste. it is cheaper to buy a new one than repair at computer store. won't buy asus again though. BTW, i am typing this on my old (very old) acer c720 which works great, just cannot be up graded to work with my bank.

I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a "bling" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running.

No Touchscreen to enable, does not work. Nothing mentioned on site. Only Touchpad is operable, no good for Excel. Very displeased with his model. Only able to use Touchpad not mouse. Difficult to use.

It did what we needed it to for a great price. It came with a junky charging cord that needed to be replaced right away, but that was still under warranty. I purchased it in July ‘22 and now March ‘24 it died. It was inconvenient to wait for a new charging cord and 2 different batteries as I tried to trouble shoot it. Nothing has worked to power it on, and I am not paying asus to fix it as their warranty was less than a year.

The laptop is sturdy and does the job for us.  She loves the touchscreen option to do her math facts practice online.It is quite heavy but nothing unbearable.I was hoping to load Microsoft Office on it; however it isn’t compatible. I’m a little bummed about that but that was my fault in not researching it more.Still love my purchase.

Unfortunately, this one is for the latter.  I purchased this device to begin with as a laptop to be used by my son for Chicago public schools and allow him to be able to access his school work. Upon receiving the first unit physically, the device looks and feels wonderful and within 2 days of starting to use it. The screen was no longer capable for touch capabilities and the keyboard was non-functional as well.  I called their customer support line at Asus and Asus. Couldn't figure out what was wrong either, but I was supposed to pay to send a device I just bought to go have it repaired by Asus and this is why I say their customer service is knowledge below standard but I would say some of the worst there is on the market today.  Amazon luckily was able to step in and send me a new unit as a replacement.  Amazon's customer service is some of the best I've ever you dealt with.  Got the new unit and now this one over here. Can't even stay connected to Wi-Fi. My kid can't do his homework.  This computer is a total piece of garbage even for something as simple as a means to do homework for a grade school.  I will never touch another asus device again and I would advise anyone else that is looking into this product to look elsewhere to avoid the frustration that I'm going through right now

I'm not using it to play games or stream movies or take pictures and videos. Though I got the no ads/32 gig model, because reading is serious business.Because it was my six year old Kindle Paperwhite that got me into this. I love reading on it, even library books. This is important, because I'm a writer (The Way of Cats book) and a devoted reader. To keep up with this favorite hobby, I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Still, there are many books, and I also subscribe to Scribd. I have books I own, and books I rent, essentially.Which makes my Paperwhite less of a general reader than I would like. I'm also researching a new book. I can send all these PDFs to my Kindle account, but it's not the same reading or highlighting experience as an optimized PDF reader. In my mind, I'd like to keep these documents, but not on my Bookshelf, mixed with the thrillers and the sciences.Recent thoughts of how long my Paperwhite would last led me to consider e-readers in general. Reading outdoors is combining two of my favorite things, where a dedicated e-ink device really shines, so some kind of Kindle reader is important to me. But I could really use a general purpose reader. This was my first attempt at combining these needs. I am very pleased.The Silk browser, included, let me navigate to the address of the Scribd app (information on the Scribd site.) This let me download a third party app, permission for which I first adjusted in settings. Currently testing PDF readers in the Amazon App Store, for some free books I got in that format.Now I have three readers in one. My Kindle and Scribd books update on my other apps, and I them as I've always done. This screen is as easy to read on as my iPad mini, so no complaints. My iPad is bigger and heavier, with the case and the Pencil, and not something I put in my purse if I don't need to. The Fire 7 works better for what I usually need a purse device for, which is reading and web browsing. My phone is really old and won't keep downloaded books for very long. The idea being that if I'm stuck somewhere with no wifi, I have books in the device. And they will be there.The Kindle app is almost fully operational, but I can't put books into Collections with it, and the layout is subtly different, but it works fine. If it gets confused, I restart it. It's not a high tech device, but it's great for the price.
## 55 So I only just got this and thought I'd share my initial review and hopefully answer questions that others might have that has been difficult to find answers for.Size differencesAs most have already seen, this version is different from the previous in shape and size, yes it is slightly smaller. For most users who had the previous version, the kicker is that your covers and cases etc. are no longer compatible.Also the Charger uses USB-C plug also which is different from the previous versions.In terms of performanceThis is night and day in comparison to the older versions.  The older version was slick when it first came out but like most people know, the FireOS is basically Android and as more and more updates have been applied, the older version is now running really slow. So basically this new version hardware was tailored for the today's version of android thus it runs very fast and very slick, this is a very crucial issue.NO YOUTUBE KIDS APPThe biggest issue anyone will encounter and is well known about is that this does not have the Google Play Store or accompanying services. That means that IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NATIVE YOUTUBE KIDS APP.There are many people on here that simply either don't understand what a native app is or simply confuse it with the main Youtube. I myself had multiple answers that failed to answer this basic question with multiple contradictory answers or reviews that failed to  understand the question.Amazon FIRE tablets DO NOT HAVE YOUTUBE KIDS Apps. Amazon has their own Youtube.com app which it seems they created as the developer email address for that app is an amazon.com email address. When you click YOUTUBE KIDS link in that app it jumps to the browser and opens in the browser which is a terrible experience. It is strange given that on the fire TV, the YouTube app allows you to switch to kids profiles, if only Amazon would do that for their tablet youtube app. But until then What you have are 3rd party apps built by you know who on the AppStore that plays youtube. They are not native apps, nor do they support most of the functionality as is. They are not written by Youtube, Google or Amazon either, so if you want to give those apps your google login which is used for Youtube Kids then you do so at your own risk.YES YOU CAN INSTALL YOUTUBE KIDS NATIVE APP, BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF.I don't know why nor will I try to even get into this very very old topic of not having youtube kids, but the GOOD news is that it is very simple and easy to get Youtube kids native apps on this 12th gen version. You don't need to be a modder or anything intense. But a simple web search will tell you how to do this. Just know that you will have to install 4 different google apps/services first to get the Play Store. This is even easier as you simply open the browser, download each of them from the website and Click to install. DONE AND DUSTED.  Once you have the Play Store you can easily install any of the native youtube Kids apps or even the original Youtube app from google and even login to your tablet with your gmail account. I was able to do this in 30 minutes.With YouTube Kids installed. I am now able to give this 10 Stars.This is basically very decent hardware and latest OS for $60.You cannot go wrong with this as a kids tablet especially with the ability from Amazon to quickly lock this down.Touch Screen is extremely responsiveI have struggled to find a decent priced kids tablet that is responsive enough to use the ANTON app without lag. This is the fastest tablet I have seen at this price point. For those that haven't used ANTON, it is by far the best app for teaching your kids. It has school derived lessons, I would recommend every parent should download ANTON. But it's writing lessons, needs a screen that is responsive and a fairly decent tablet. This tablet passes the ANTON test with a gold star.Sound is clear with some bass. It doesn't sound like a tin can.Sound quality is very loud and clear. Trust me, if you've been through the dozen kids tablets I have, you will be surprised how much of a let down it would be when you have poor sound. Kids need to hear clearly and this does it without issues.The Amazon AppStore itself is actually pretty good. All the apps we had on our old android tablet were available except for Youtube Kids. I'd imagine there are many more that are not available but most of the decent kids ones are on there including ANTON, ABC Kids etcI would think that since the FireTV Youtube app allows kids profiles, that Amazon would at some point do the same with their own tablet Youtube app.As it is right now this table is almost perfect especially once I was able to manually install play store and youtube kids easily. I'm ordering a second one.

It's okay if all you want to do is basic word processing and mundane basic programs, youtube videos etc. But the display is tiring to look it bc it's not as crisp as I've become used to. Overall decent laptop

Super fast and SILENT. Literally makes no sound (except from speaker of course) while its running. The SSD is 1TB and super fast. Plenty of RAM and processer power. The Nvidia GeForce video card is great. I haven't played many games yet, but the ones I did I ran at FULL graphics settings... I thought it might not be able to run smooth with AA at 8x AF on, but it handled it perfectly! The backlit keyboard is blue and you can adjust the light. Great for typing in the dark like I do. I do not have anything negative to say about this machine... Its the best bang I could find for my buck! Also fast shipping and great seller! Thanks!

The large screen size is perfect for multitasking, gaming, or watching movies, with clear colors and details that make everything look good. Performs very well handling heavy workloads and multiple applications without any lag. The keyboard is comfortable, and the battery life is impressive for a laptop of this size. It’s portable enough to take on the go but also feels sturdy and well-built.Overall very happier with my purchase. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for power, performance, and a fantastic viewing experience all in one.

It met all my expectations and was quite easy to set up. Computer arrived in good shape. Very light and slim. Plenty of storage. Transfer of files and settings from prior laptop shockingly easy and fast. I used to have to wait 5 minutes for my old computer to start up. This one starts almost instantly when I open it up from sleep. I tend to use 4 or 5 programs at once so I keep it challenged. I'm not a gamer so I can't honestly say how it works for gaming, but I imagine it would do well, based on using it for other graphics related things and streaming movies.

Even though I kept using it, it eventually became unbearable, so I decided it was time for a new one. Since my wife uses the laptop more often than I do, I chose this pink one. Honestly, I really love the color! I usually go for silver laptops, as they’re more common, but trying this new color really made me appreciate it more. My wife was also impressed by it!Although the brand isn’t very well-known, a friend recommended it, and after trying it out, I found it has everything we need. The specs and features are quite comprehensive, and for the price, it’s a great deal compared to more expensive brands offering similar features. The price is really affordable, and when comparing it to other brands, I think it’s worth every penny. Both my wife and I are really happy with this laptop – it performs quickly and efficiently. Definitely a great purchase!

Just some basic needs. This one I couldn't let pass me by as the price was incredibly affordable during October Prime Days. I was a bit skeptical at first but the screen and keyboard are great size, the picture is great, sound quality is great, the setup was easy and it is exactly what I need it for. Definitely more than expected.Great purchase!

I have downloaded APPS that I use for work and the computer handles everything without issues and I have plenty of memory. I would recommend this laptop to anyone.

                                                                                                                                                                                                           I purchased this to set up my new office. After combing through the vast selection of other chairs and all the reviews, I decided on this chair and I could not be happier.Before I launch into my assessment of the chair, I just want to say that you should absolutely buy it if you are thinking about purchasing this particular one. I have had many desk chairs of varying prices, sizes, features, etc. and this chair has thoroughly impressed me.Let's start with the assembly, which was so easy and straightforward. I saw some complaints about having a hard time with setting it up, but honestly, just use your brain and all will be ok. I am sure many could set this up without the instructions, which I did until I got to setting up the built-in speakers.I sit in this chair daily for hours and it is SO comfortable. Being able to adjust the back to several different angles is fantastic. The head and lumbar pillows are also great at giving some added support; they never feel like they're in the way. Reclining the chair to its furthest extent offers a very comfortable resting position, and, along with the added foot rest, it truly is a remarkably comfy "recliner" chair. The armrests are adjustable and offer some rotation so you can find the sweet spot for yourself.The built-in speakers are nifty too. **Disclaimer: You must buy the Bluetooth USB Receiver to utilize this feature.** I wasn't expecting much from them, but I do find myself switching to use them for certain entertainment purposes like listening to background music while I work or when I am playing specific games, in particular horror or racing games. The sound is way better than I anticipated, though they do lack bass. The relay unit lasts for hours (days usually for me) and charges quickly enough to never create frustration.Some other notes:-I saw a few complaints about the packaging and indentations created from remaining bundled up in the box. However, I did not experience this at all. All of the cushioned pieces came out of the box well packaged and without blemishes of any kind.-There was an odor initially when taking it out of the box. Ya know, that warehouse smell. After an hour or so, the smell had completely dissipated.-In regards to the Top Critical Review for this chair; That customer is absolutely insane and I cannot fathom what they were expecting for a chair in this price range. I used to have a fancy $980 chair provided from my employer, the largest social media entity. Comparatively, I am far happier with this chair. Yes, there are some plastic parts (dust covers, gas lift cover, armrests) but the expensive chair had the same plastic components. I feel less tension in my lower back after spending 6+ hours in this chair vs the expensive one where I would find myself getting up to walk around every so often to relieve the pain in my lower back. Oh, and they had mentioned missing parts due to the box being damaged (which has no bearing on the product itself); those particular items cannot be lost as they are attached to the chair and in a special pouch located on the back of the chair (see photo). They obviously didn't realize that.All-in-all, this is an excellent purchase for anyone who is looking at a new desk chair. The price is phenomenal for the quality and the amount of features. There is also a good amount of colors to choose from so you can better match your style and decor.

YT videos of this chair but was hesitant to order online but for $160 how bad could it be?Similar style chairs in Office Max start around $300 but with bonded leather which is commonly known to peel and tear over time.This is PU leather which is not as breathable but sturdy like vinyl without cracking or peeling.First off, assembly is extremely straight forward with incredible step by step instructions.  Hats off to whoever put it together.The seat is surprisingly comfortable and sturdy, as the YT reviews suggested but much more comfortable than I would’ve expected.  I needed a more firm and supportive chair so don’t expect to sink in and be plushy.Every video BASHED the speaker quality comparing it to laptop equivalence. I had low expectations and thought it was more of a gimmick but these are actually louder and having more bass than what YT videos would have you think.  Don’t expect full Bose type quality but for the size of the speakers I would compare it to a smaller JBL flip. These speakers DO NOT distort at high volumes or deep bass (my music of choice is EDM)My only complaint is the foot rest, I wouldn’t pay the money for it.  I’m 5”10 with slightly longer legs than normal and the footrest is more of a calf rest.  My feet hang off and I wish it could come out a few more inches.  The foot rest is not that sturdy and has some give. It’s not well crafted and not really worth using by if you’re under 5’10 than this May suit you well.All in all, exceptional quality, easy to assemble and I would definitely look into this as a really good alternative to the Respawn 110

exactly what I was looking for!  The assembly was a breeze thanks to the awesome manual that came with it.  It is very comfortable, and I love that it has such a wide recline range! The lumbar and head pillows are adjustable and are very supportive. The footstool is pretty decent, could be a bit longer for taller folks but it does okay, plus I don't plan to use that part too often.  The quality of the speakers is pretty good for the price of the chair and work great for meetings, watching YouTube, or streaming your favorite music. Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend.

商品の組み立ては説明書通りに作業をしていけば、簡単に組み立てできます。時間の多い、少ないは人によって違うと思いますので参考にはならないと思いますが、自分は２時間程度かかりました。椅子に座った感じは個人個人違うと思いますが、自分にはちょっと硬めに感じました。実は配達になった商品ですが、左のスピーカーに不具合があり、うまく音が出ませんでした。販売元にメールで問い合わせを行ったところ、土曜日だったのですが、すぐに連絡があり、２～３試してもらいたいとのことでした。指示通り試したみたのですが、改善されませんでした。そうするとすぐに「背もたれ」のみ代替え品を送付するとの連絡があり、倉庫が土日休みで月曜日の発送になるとのことでしたが、そのとおり火曜日には代替え品が配達になりました。代替え品は特に問題なく使用できています。品質管理をしっかりといいたいところですが、その後の対応は迅速・丁寧で素晴らしいと感じました。星を４としたのは品質管理の問題で-１です。

## 11  8-13-22I abuse this chair, and it just won’t die! I still love it!I have gained a bit of weight since I got this chair, but I have never stopped flopping into it full dead weight, and it always takes it with ease!I sit in it sideways with my head on one arm and my legs propped up on or draped over the other.I push against the back way harder than I should while seated to stretch out my back, it has never even hinted at slipping/breaking.My grandkids push each other around on our hardwood floors, spinning it roughly and intentionally into other furniture.The arms now wiggle a bit, and a screw fell off it which I could not ever figure out where it fell from; other than that this chair is flawless!The hydraulics still work flawlessly.The reclining mechanism still works flawlessly.The upholstery basically still looks like it did when it was new; and the cushioning is still cushiony.I rarely use the leg rest so it still functions as new.Highly recommend this chair!2-22-20I am still head over heals in love with this chair and stand by my original 5 star rating.My original concerns are  addressed here:STITCHING - The stitching has held up beautifully!  I am super rough on this chair, I sit cross legged on it while wearing Doc Marten boots with metal clasps and drag my feet across the seat constantly.  The stitching has not been affected at all by this (nor has the PU leather for that matter).ARM STABILITY - A week in the right arm became wobbly, I discovered the screws were loose, tightened them and the arm has not wobbled since.  NOTE:  I am super rough on the right arm in particular.  I often sit slightly sideways in the chair leaning my full 140 pounds against that arm, and in order to adjust the recline I have lean over the arm at the waist to reach the lever, again pushing against the arm with my full 140 pound weight.LEG REST- The leg rest is used frequently and I quite often forget to be gentle with it.  Despite this the leg rest is no more wobbly than the day I put the chair together.This chair is proving to be a fantastic buy for the money, much better than I had even hoped!  I would most definitely repeat this purchase!Original review follows:1-15-2020  The chair arrived right on schedule.  I have been in possession of it for 3.5 hours, and am sitting in it now writing this review.Facts to consider when reading this review:> I am a 5'2" woman of average build - 10 pounds overweight is average right - in my 40's>  I have very short arms> I have absolutely no upper body strength to speak of.>  I am NOT A GAMER - I bought this chair for use at my writing desk and watching television> Any numeric ratings in this review are on a scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being the worst and 10 being the bestPACKAGING  > RATING: 10 <>  It was like Tetris inside that box, with each individually wrapped stuffed component, and two boxes of hardware  being separated  by simple sheets of cardboard.  There was absolutely no Styrofoam - it was beautiful!>  Despite appearing like a tightly packed Tetris board I had absolutely no trouble getting everything out of the box,  even with my complete lack of upper body strength.EASE OF ASSEMBLY  > Rating:  11 <> From sealed box to fully assembled in about an hour  > This includes unboxing, taking inventory, sorting and arranging the components in the order and groups they  would be needed  > OCD what can I say <  >  I completed the entire assembly by myself, completed unattended with one exception:  >  I had boyfriend hold the back in place while I got the screws that hold it to the seat started - I only got them  started enough to stay put, then sent the boyfriend away, but I could have done it alone if necessary  >  I could actually follow the instructions ... I am, unfortunately, stereotypically female when it comes to  following instructions that contain only pictures with no text at all - these instructions were over the top easy  to followINITIAL INSPECTION AFTER ASSEMBLY  > RATING: 9.9 <>  Every component, from the upholstered pieces to the washers in the tool kit, was in pristine condition>  All joints and connection points were flawlessly aligned, smooth and sturdy>  It is very visually appealing and identical to the images the seller supplied on it's page  >  NOTE:  I did not use the wheels it came with as we have hardwood floors, so I had also ordered inline skate wheels  at the same time and used them instead - it should be further noted that the wheels appeared to be pristine and  are being saved for use on another piece of furniture in the future>  Loss of .01 in rating due to the thread used in the stitching looking thinner than I would expect for a chair of this  price and quality design/manufacturing  > It should be noted that I had read about feature on several "Top Ten Gaming Chairs of 2019" websites so I was not  surprised to note thisFUNCTIONALITY  > RATING: 9.25 <>  I cannot rate the wheels, as I mentioned earlier I have not yet used them.  They were therefore completed excluded  from the rating.> The seat is very comfortable, the padding is very firm, but gives just the right amount for me to feel like it stay comfy for a good long time - when comparing this note to other reviews remember I am 5'2" and about 130 pounds fully clothed  >  Due, I assume, to my size, I am unable to lower the chair! LOL  Apparently I do not weigh enough to activated the  hydraulics!  LOL  Being a little overweight, I was quite pleased with this discovery, but, to be fair no extra points were added to the rating for this.>  The seat back contour was very well designed.  Again, due to my stature - and I keep mentioning this because so  many of the reviews seem to be written by big and tall men - it doesn't "hug" me like it is designed to do,  HOWEVER, it is still quite comfortable.  The contour was apparently designed around the center of the seat in a  slope so that I can still feel the hint of the hug.>  My feet do not touch the floor in the lowest position!  LOL  I knew from the dimensions that the seller provided on  the page that this would be the case.  No points were deducted for this.>  The arms that are mentioned in almost every review as being wobbly, are, at least at 3 hours into use not wobbling  at all, but definitely feel like they could more secure.  > This has been mentioned to varying degree in almost ever review I read and I visited and read reviews at four top  ten websites, Amazon, Walmart, Sams, Costco, and about a half dozen other random websites.  >  Loss of .25 in rating for mediocre arm stability>  The lumbar support just got in my way.  The seat back has enough of "bump" in just the right place for me.  I am  saving it for possible later in the chair's life.  No rating points deducted, this is just personal preference.>  The head rest is nowhere near in the right place for me and I am not using it, although I am saving it for possible use  on something else down the line.  Again, personal preference, no points deducted.> The leg rest is an AWESOME FEATURE!  It was most definitely a selling point for me.  >  The farthest edge of the leg rest falls at the very top of my ankle and is very comfortable. > I am 5'2" <  >  Engaging and retracting the leg rest is apparently a learned skill and at 3 hours in I am still a little stop and go.  >  No points deducted as I can tell it operator learning curve and not a mechanical problem.>  In the retracted position the leg rest mechanism feels extremely secure.>  In the engaged position it is obvious that the arms holding it to the underside of the seat are not as secure as they  should be; enough so that I worry about accidentally putting too much weight on the leg rest and snapping the  arms off their mount.  >  The arms are attached to the seat bottom much too close to the edge of the seat; if the back end of the arms  were longer and mounted further back on the seat bottom they would be much sturdier.  > Loss of 0.5 points deducted from the rating for insecure mounting of leg rest.>  EASE OF CONTROL  >RATING: 10<  >  Reclining and return action is very smooth with only minimal learning curve.  I was a pro in less than a minute.  >  The Recline Lock and Height Lock controllers are just barely within my comfort zone of reach, I have to lean over  the side quite a bit to reach them.  Furniture is not designed for short people, no points deducted.  >  I cannot speak to the wheels as I am not using them, and they were not included in the rating.OVERALL RATING:  9.85Please forgive any typos, I am sure I missed some.  LOLI will come back in a few weeks/months with an update to this review,

      So far the best chair I have had. I love the cloth chair, and how much cushion it has. Nice and sturdy. I just put on the roller blade wheels instead of the wheels that it comes with.

 I bought this chair for gaming, and have been using it for a while. It's not a bad chair. It was really easy and straight forward as far as assembly goes and only took about 30 minutes. Feels pretty solid and sturdy (for a 6'7", 350 lb dude). The only complaint I have is the seat cushion is a bit too soft and my butt gets sore after a couple of hours of sitting in it, which I see as a good thing actually, since I believe that people should get up and move around every now and then instead of sitting in front of their PC all day, get the blood flowing again you know?.If you see it the way I see it, then this chair will be a good fit for you. Good price, quick assembly, rolls smooth and everything works exactly the way it should. Box had some wear when it got to me, but no big deal.

easy to clean. Price was less then expected and very pleased with it overall. The only draw back was there is no handle adjustment and did fit on my computer desk but one can work around it.

                                                          Hello Chair Shoppers!Right before the pandemic, I bought a $50 chair from a large company the retails furniture. I won't mention any names, but they are a large Warehouse, specializing in Furniture, and they are American.Anyways... It was the cheapest chair there (but about $70), and, at the time, it seemed to tick all the boxes for what I needed. A couple of months later, I began working my day job from home, as well as another roughly 40 hours a week doing my second "job," solo game development.I ended up spending about 16 hours a day in that chair... upwards of 20... and I paid the price for it. I ended up with Hip Bursitis, and I've been walking with a cane for the last month or so, healing up.Obviously, the chair wasn't fully to blame. I should've taken more stretch breaks, excersized more, etc... Fast forward to the end of November (Right before the Hip Bursitis struck) and I mentioned to my mother that I was shopping for a chair. She ended up offering to buy me one for a Christmas present, and I decided to go with this Respawn Chair, primarily because of the inclusion of the FOOT REST (to put my leg up and stretch out throughout the day).When I got the chair, I was blown away. easy to put together, fantastic materials, and just head and shoulders above my old chair (granted, my old chair was the cheapest one I could find brand new).I am SO glad I upgraded. I love my new chair. A few days after purchasing, however, I cracked the Foot Rest a tiny bit. The jury is still out on whose fault it was.... but office chairs are pricey, and I figured I would take a stab at getting a replacement part.When I sent in the form to possibly get the Foot Rest part replaced, I was replied to immediately. Even though it was between Christmas and New Years, I received the replacement part within days.Dealing with Respawn has been a fantastic Customer Experience, and I couldn't be happier with my new chair.THANKS RESPAWN!

el material ve resistente y de calidad. Recomendada si vas a estar muchas horas sentado. El envío fue muy rápido, el paquete llegó en una semana aunque si creo que sería bueno que protegieran más las piezas porque por el peso y supongo que el ajetreo del viaje, la caja llegó perforada de algunas partes. Fuera de eso la funcionalidad es excelente! Vale cada peso definitivamente \U{01f929}

de el reposa brazos de el lado izquierdo ya esta completamente hundida, el reposa pies a resistido pero se siente muy frágil, como que en cualquier momento se va a romper ya que en cuanto pones las piernas se inclina hacia abajo con el peso, y eso no debería de pasar con una persona de complexion media(peso 80kg), el resto se siente comodo y fue facil de armar, pero esperaba mas calidad en esas dos partes ya que es por lo que decidi comprar esta silla, si no te importa el reposa pies mejor compra otra silla, si no te importa que el reposa brazos no sea acolchonado mejor compra otra silla, y si te importan tanto el reposa brazos como el reposa pies mi anterior silla drakon cumplia mejor con esa funcionalidad y despues de 2 años todavia funcionaban bien el reposa brazos y reposa pies

las 5 estrellas porque si pasas todo el día te cansa, esperaba que fuera más cómoda. Y también hay que ajustarle los brazos cada cierto tiempo porque se van aflojando con el paso de los días.

me llego el Viernes 29Mayo20 , super Rapido.  5 puntos2) El Mismo 29 lo instale super sencillo la instalación 20 min.  5 puntos3) Buena silla super comoda. 5 puntos4) Me vino con un detalle : el reposa brazo derecho vino roto en la tela,  entre el espaldar y el posa brazos, donde se atornilla.  Muy mal allí.Igual lo instale y la deje en la casa, espero que el proveedor se contacte conmigo. Tengo mas fotos y videos de que me vino rota, es lago sencillo pero si estoy pagando un producto costoso deseo que venga sin defectos.Allí dejos las fotos para que la vean.Si recomiendo el producto,  solo ese detalle, espero que el proveedor me contacte para mostrarles los videos y tenga mas cuidado en las próximos entregas, de eso se trata este feedback, para que sigan mejorando en esos detalles.

major upgrade. I have already taken one nap in it and slept well (the foot rest is amazing). I wish the bottom cushion was a bit more comfortable but I am being incredibly nitpicky. The chair also seems to be of solid construction so far. The only thing I think is a potential con is if you are not confident in building things because the chair came quite dis-assembled and took some time to put together (about an hour or so). If you are not comfortable with building things either go a different direction or be prepared to get some help. Otherwise I think great for the cost. I imagine other gaming chairs with the same quality and features are more around the $200 mark so this is great for someone who does not want to spend $400 on a chair but still wants features, comfort, and quality.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It came quickly in the mail within four days. it only took us  30 minutes to assemble it and I didn’t even need the instructions - come on it’s a chair with only a few pieces to assemble lol and it was very easy to follow the directions if you needed to refer back. Of course I am kind of a handy guy with tools, but even if you have a little bit of experience you shouldn’t have a problem putting this chair together there’s really not that many pieces to assemble. I’ve seen people write some reviews saying that they took two hours to figure it out and that’s just ridiculous. It’s really comfortable and fun to use. It has a lot of options like recline, extra padding for lumbar support and neck support and it’s, fully adjustable, and very well-made, and most importantly priced fairly. I’ve seen chairs go for way more and this one is just as good.Im going to get another for office at my garage. It’s so sporty looking! I keep seeing people say this thing breaks? Well, I’m 220lbs and five feet eleven and I didn’t break the foot rest like these other people who must be slam dancing in the chair all night lol come on guys this is a 200 dollar middle of the road chair that’s giving you a lot of nice options and features, AND for a fair price! This isn’t a premium office chair you’ll find in a law firm, bank, or executives conference room, those chairs are usually 1000 dollars folks. I’m also buying the matching desk they make too right after I’m done posting this review. Because I’ve bought many office chairs over the years and I’m having the most fun with this one. And yes, this chair is best fitted for certain “frame types” let’s say, but I’m no small guy and I take care of my stuff that I buy and I’m not rough with it. It’s great for gaming for a few hours and  he’ll yeah as well as kicking back the recline feature and talking on the phone lol I’m so buying another chair for my office at the garage and a desk too! I wanna look cool over there and this chair screams racing!  I don’t care if it lasts only a few years, or maybe it will be last more since I take good care of things,  I’m not using it to go on a ship into outer space with the dam thing! I don’t need a five hundred dollar elite brand chair for my every day work. A buddy of mine has the same chair in his garage with a rough edged floor, grease, and chemicals and he’s had his chair a whole year beating on it and it never broke, I don’t know what these people are doing with the chair but they can’t be treating them correctly. So pound for pound and option for option, this was the best deal going. And anyone who says this chair is less then four stars surely doesn’t know what there talking about. I sat on this chair six hours today and the padding and pillows were satisfactory. Of course my leg was a bit sore because heck, nobody should sit for that long on any chair!lol  But for the money, and the design, I think this chair is just fine.

It is surprisingly comfortable when reclining. The neck support helps. First time I used it, I didn’t realize I was playing for hours and hours. It is easy to move around. It was a little difficult to assemble-just some parts were bulky and definitely needed two helpers! The foot rest that slides out is ok, it feels a little flimsy to me. Could be sturdier. Overall a great chair for hours of gaming entertainment.

                                  A disaster of a transaction all around and I strongly urge anyone paying attention not to buy this.The building process is awful, screws don't easily go into holes, instructions aren't clear, etc. It took me 5-6 hours to get it built and this is the 4th chair like this I've had so I like to think I know what I am doing.Once built, the 2 most important parts didn't work. The lever for the back of the chair did nothing, thus the back stood straight up with zero give to lean back. Also, the gas canister under the seat part did not work so there as no ability to raise/lower the seat.I took out a 2-year warranty/protection plan thankfully. HOWEVER, ran into more issues with that. The company claimed they sent it, was scheduled for delivery on Feb. 6 arriving independently from the chair. This got delayed until Feb. 8. Then Feb. 9. Finally on Feb. 13 I checked and the tracking number indicated it might be lost.Amazon contacted the company to open a case and have the respond/get me out a new protection plan/paperwork but instead of discussing and doing this the VERY QUICKLY canceled my 2-year protection plan and issued a refund without even consulting me.So, for a brief while, I had a defective chair that did not work at all and no protection plan to apply for a refund.Thankfully, Amazon took care of it and refunded me everything but urged me to write this.I suspect this company is a scam. The price of the chair is so low for a reason. Cause it's a bad product that doesn't work well. The company knows this, they know most won't take out a warranty for such a cheap item. I did, which had them worried so they quickly canceled/refunded it once they knew I had an issue with the chair and would want to use this warranty for a refund.BUYER BEWARE

They provided a new working cylinder no charge also delivered promptly. Final assembly works as advertised and is in my opinion a good value.

                                                      Unfortunately the instructions had some errors for example they referred to screw (N) however N was the head rest so had to eliminate where other screws would go to determine which to use.  Also when connecting the arm, the instructions had the screws the wrong way round which resulted in some damage to the arm rest where the screws poked through.  Disappointing as I paid a lot for a chair that is now damaged. Other than the assembly issues, the chair itself is great.  It's very sturdy and I love the footrest and recline functions.

confusing instructions but got over it. The chair, unfortunately, slides down. I don't know if it is underspec'd gas lift or what but it is not great. And comfort wise, it's fine.Stay away from it.

but it is solid and feels great, love the finish and the colors look great, like I said just a few screws took me less than 10 min to build it, and again feels super solid, very happy with it.

Nice large chair but fits great in a small office. Looks high-end very supportive with back and neck pillows. Very comfortable for hours of playing after looking at all the reviews this one was definitely a good choice.

The ergonomic design is on point, and the footrest is a game-changer (pun intended). Whether you're gaming or working, you'll appreciate the support it provides.The reclining feature is also a nice touch. Being able to adjust the angle is great for preventing stiffness during long sessions. And the swivel and rocker functions? Super convenient.Now, onto durability. While the chair feels solid overall, there are a few areas that could be improved. Some users have reported issues with the armrests feeling a bit wobbly, and the fabric can be prone to wear and tear over time.And let's talk about that navy blue color. It's stylish, sure, but it might not be to everyone's taste. Personally, I love it, but I can see how some people might prefer something a bit more neutral.Overall, I'd give the GTRACING Footrest, Ergonomic Computer Game Desk, Reclining Gamer Chair a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It's comfy, supportive, and built to last, but it's not without its minor flaws. If you're in the market for a gaming chair, it's definitely worth considering.

                                                  Best chair I’ve had by far for the price. Decent size. Height was perfect for my desk. Pretty stable for reclining. It does as the ad says.

assembly. Instructions were easy to follow, and it took maybe 20 minutes to get fully assembled. The chair functioned perdectly after assembly, and I have to say this chair is certainly worth the money.On pure aesthetics, this chair is a 10! The lumbar support is perfect and easy to adjust (you just slide ot up/down to where you need it. The adjustabke height on the arm rests has a large range, and easily adjusta low enough to get under my desk. The heavy duty weight rating is perfect for a 250lb guy.The only problem i have is the comfort. For a young man or a light-weight person it will be fine, but the seat just isnt made for a heavy older man who sits behind a desk for 12 hours a day. My rear end gets sore after a couple of hours and i have to use a cushion on the seat for some relief.

have an older model of this GTracing chair, so when my son requested a gaming chair and purple theme, I just purchased a newer version of what I currently have.These chairs are pretty great for the price and the newer model seems to have a thinner back design.My son absolutely adores the chair, so I'm happy. I do wish the armrests were a bit more controlled and that the pullout foot lounger seems cheap and hard to move around.Overall a great chair that can last. I've had mine cor a few years now and it didn't show signs of aging until recently (after owning this chair for approx. 4 yrs).

The directions are VERY unclear on how to build the chair and I don’t like that the arm rests don’t lock into place and easily move if bumped. Otherwise it’s perfect and so far a good value. Hopefully it is well built and lasts long.

hour to assemble it. Instructions were perfect! Sturdy and comfortable, though a bit snug width wise. I am 325lbs, 6’1” tall. Snug on my hips, but I can manage. I will add a seat cushion for longer sitting periods. This is my office chair for long ZOOM and video calls. I’m not a gamer. Great value! Rolls great on carpet and fits perfectly with my corner desk in the room. Highly recommend!

                                                                                                                                                                              I'm a big believer in "you get what you pay for" and I usually advise to save up, make one purchase, make one investment and don't worry about it for a few years. But something about this chair's value really scales, especially if you can grab it on sale. I got mine in white for $75 including tax and shipping. Many quality gaming chairs cost hundreds of dollars. There a handful of cheap office chairs you can snag for $60. This chair compared to one of those generic office chair is worth the extra $15. If you're looking at this chair for $90 or higher, then the former statement is true (save up). Anyway. I've had this chair for a day now and it isn't perfect. I'll go over what I like and what I don't like.Appearance: It looks nice. Doesn't look or feel too cheap. The base is metal with plastic feet. Many chairs have plastic base with plastic feet.+1ptFunctionality: This chair has a handful of features--You can adjust the height. +1ptBut it only has about a 3in range -1ptIt has a lock to let you remain upright and can be unlocked so you can recline back. +1ptIt does NOT have a way to lock in the reclined position. -1ptComfort: This chair is pretty comfy. It has a removable/adjustable head pillow and a removable/adjustable lumbar pillow as well. +1ptIt is a little stiff. Some people may like that. It also may break it after a while. I've only had it one day so I will update if something new develops. The chair has a *mostly* comfortable width to me. It measures 19" for arm to arm. But it has this little "cushion" that tries to contour your legs that makes it a little uncomfortable to sit with my legs spread even a little. I have to keep my knees closer together than I normally would to keep the "cushion" from digging into the side of my legs. Because of this, there is really only about 16" of room for your butt or the sides of your thighs. I'm about 5'10" Male 215lbs size 38 pants XL shirt. I think I am at the cusp of being able to comfortably sit in this. It was not made with larger people in mind. It does state a 250lb weight limit while we're on the topic. -1ptAssembly: I've assembled several office chairs before and this process was similar and just as easy. +1ptIf you aren't experienced or if you struggle with Ikea stuff, you may find it difficult. The hardware that they include is kinda junk. If you have the luxury of using your own hardware (or hand tools at least), I would highly recommend it. I had one bolt that had really junky threads from the factory and I couldn't do much about it, just had to cross thread it and tighten it the best I could. I had another bolt that stripped and the thread never would grab. Luckily there was one extra included in the packaging and I ended up being able to tighten it without cross threading. I think I got lucky. 90% of the assembly was smooth sailing and the few snags that arose, I knew exactly what to do. Again, if you aren't experienced with this, it could easily turn into a headache and a return to amazon over poor quality hardware

Very comfortable, the back support pillow is sturdy but also comfortable at the same time. Very quiet chair which is great.

I ended up going back to my old office chair due to multiple reasons.1. Arms Bind the legs this causes both discomfort and numbness.2. Wire frame within the chair broke at the welds meaning the back support failed and it no longer does what I bought if for.3. I is no longer useable because the arms now snapped meaning the whole back flops back. apparently you are not supposed to relax back in the chair at all because it is not designed for that.

he was complaining about his computer chair being uncomfortable.  It's very nice quality,  it's is grey and black.  He loves the lower back support and the fact that it reclines.  Very comfy!

comfortable, and looks nice while not being overly gamer nor boring looking. I have a gripe, which is that the assembly is not a 15 minute process. I'm no expert with putting together chairs, tables, etc, however I have taken apart and put back together my PC dozens of times, so I'm no stranger to tinkering with screws, small pieces, and heavy objects. It took me around an hour and a half to fully construct the chair if we include me unpacking everything, and undoing a mistake I made where I mixed up the screws due to the diagram making them look similar in size. Seriously, the instructions make the screws easy to mix up with their similar looking sizes in the pictures. When you hold the screws in your hand, they do look different. Quite different. I believe that it would take 15 minutes for someone highly versed and experienced in building and taking apart furniture, chairs, dressers, etc. Someone that's been doing it for years.In terms of comfort and build, this is unbeatable for the price. Hands down. My old chair was of the mesh variety, and came from the same seller. While it wasn't falling apart, it was quite squeaky and after nearly 3 and a half years of use, I felt like I needed an upgrade. I'm glad I did. This chair oozes comfort. Going from crappy, foamy office chairs, to a decent mesh chair, and then to this is like going from 30fps to 60fps, and then going to 144fps. It's a change that you have to experience to understand. From the armrests, to the overall quality of the backrest, to the cushions supporting your head and lumbar (lower spine), this chair knocks it out of the park.The installation isn't a fast process for everyone. I can understand why these chairs don't come prebuilt, as the size of the box would be much bigger on top of using more cardboard. With that being said, I do hope for a future when installations are plug and play levels of easy. The last thing you want to be after spending a good chunk of money on a new, comfy chair is to be annoyed and thus uncomfortable. Still, I think this is a doable installation for most. I did it in a small room with not much space. I recommend a garage with some space around you, or a living room with some room.

choice for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet comfortable office chair. After using it for some time, I'm impressed with its design, which provides good support during long working hours. The chair is easy to assemble, and the materials feel durable for its price range.However, I was disappointed with the extra shipping cost, which took away from the overall value. Despite this, the chair itself is a great deal and performs well compared to others in the same price bracket. It's comfortable, supportive, and worth considering if you're looking for an affordable office/gaming chair.

This chair looked similar and was only $150 so I decided to give it a try. Is it as good as that $800 gaming chair? No. Definitely not. But it's still a comfortable chair that I like more than the chair I was using.I like the material. It's soft and feels good on my bare skin. I had to put armrest covers on my other chair because the hard plastic would irritate my forearms. No need for those on this chair. The seat, back, arms, and headrest are all covered with this material, whatever it is, and padded with a dense foam underneath. The lumbar pad offers nice back support and the headrest is quite comforting. I also like that the main support post is higher off the ground than any of my other office chairs by a couple inches.The back reclines and locks in place at whichever angle you desire, which is really cool. Unfortunately, it reclines too easily for me. There isn't enough resistance. I think that's my one major gripe, but even that's not too bad. I locked it in at a certain angle and have been okay with that. Still, I wish they would have made the resistance adjustable like all my other office chairs.So I guess I should get into some of the downsides, all of which are pretty minor. The armrest height is not adjustable. For me, that's fine as they're already at the perfect height. It comes with a leg rest thing which I found to be uncomfortable. The edge of it hits my legs at just the wrong place. I've never used one of these before and not even sure why I would want to. The lumbar pillow just sits on the seat, it doesn't connect in any way. In my friend's $800 chair this and the headrest both connect via magnets. The headrest on this attaches via elastic band.For $150 this is a very nice chair. It's no $800 chair but it looks nice and is comfortable on the butt, back, arms, and head.

                                                              Since my old chair was falling apart due to thin leather and no cushioning it was time to upgrade.This new chair looks super professional and is actually very comfortable. It has a soft suede like material instead of a cold leather with a nice stitched patternSetup was super quick and only took me 30 minutes since it was all just 3 big pieces that screw togetherEverything was packaged safely in bubble wrap and plastic sleeves, tools were included and the different screws were clearly labeled in the simple instruction sheetIt was a little difficult getting the back panel lined up doing it solo so best to have a 2nd person for that part to make it even easierOverall, this chair is a great addition to my startup gaming area

                                                                 Ordered this chair to replace an aging Branch ergonomic chair. The product was received well packaged protecting good quality components. It took me about 30 minutes to assemble using the simple 1 page directions and included hex/Phillips combi tool.The color is a little darker than shown on the product page - more of a bluish slate color that should go well with most decors (see photo). Initial impressions are that the seat is pretty firm, which differs from the product description ("super soft and wide cushion"). I'm hoping it will soften with more use. The seat bottom and back are wide, easily accommodating my 6'1" 240LB frame.The upholstery is described as a fabric having excellent breathability. It feels like PU leather to me rather than a fabric. I'm hoping the material is breathable when we get back into the warmer Southern California weather. It IS soft and comfortable, and is also used for the seat pillow, lumbar cushion and footrest.Speaking of the footrest, not sure what the function is. It slides directly out of the seat bottom. which is no where near my feet. Perhaps gamers might use it depending on how they sit in the chair but the position would be beyond my old dad body.Summarizing, the chair is sturdy and made from good quality materials. It is easy to assemble and feels solid when completed. It is roomy, and has adjustments for seat height and seat back recline. The seat bottom is firm when received. Combined with the testing noted in the product description I should get years of service.

                                             Bought this for my hubby who's a gamer and our other chair broke. He had a raid coming up so we ordered this and he used it the entire time. Its sofy leather feeling, comfy cushions firm but not hard. The lumbar support is good and the head rest is super helpful! It was simple to put together and instructions made sense. It's sturdy and held my 6'0 275 lb hubby and he's using it daily for work and gaming! The color is a nice black gray color and easy to wipe spills off when my kiddo spilled juice it was easy to clean it up and didn't stain!

                                                                                                                                                                                                           I purchased this to set up my new office. After combing through the vast selection of other chairs and all the reviews, I decided on this chair and I could not be happier.Before I launch into my assessment of the chair, I just want to say that you should absolutely buy it if you are thinking about purchasing this particular one. I have had many desk chairs of varying prices, sizes, features, etc. and this chair has thoroughly impressed me.Let's start with the assembly, which was so easy and straightforward. I saw some complaints about having a hard time with setting it up, but honestly, just use your brain and all will be ok. I am sure many could set this up without the instructions, which I did until I got to setting up the built-in speakers.I sit in this chair daily for hours and it is SO comfortable. Being able to adjust the back to several different angles is fantastic. The head and lumbar pillows are also great at giving some added support; they never feel like they're in the way. Reclining the chair to its furthest extent offers a very comfortable resting position, and, along with the added foot rest, it truly is a remarkably comfy "recliner" chair. The armrests are adjustable and offer some rotation so you can find the sweet spot for yourself.The built-in speakers are nifty too. **Disclaimer: You must buy the Bluetooth USB Receiver to utilize this feature.** I wasn't expecting much from them, but I do find myself switching to use them for certain entertainment purposes like listening to background music while I work or when I am playing specific games, in particular horror or racing games. The sound is way better than I anticipated, though they do lack bass. The relay unit lasts for hours (days usually for me) and charges quickly enough to never create frustration.Some other notes:-I saw a few complaints about the packaging and indentations created from remaining bundled up in the box. However, I did not experience this at all. All of the cushioned pieces came out of the box well packaged and without blemishes of any kind.-There was an odor initially when taking it out of the box. Ya know, that warehouse smell. After an hour or so, the smell had completely dissipated.-In regards to the Top Critical Review for this chair; That customer is absolutely insane and I cannot fathom what they were expecting for a chair in this price range. I used to have a fancy $980 chair provided from my employer, the largest social media entity. Comparatively, I am far happier with this chair. Yes, there are some plastic parts (dust covers, gas lift cover, armrests) but the expensive chair had the same plastic components. I feel less tension in my lower back after spending 6+ hours in this chair vs the expensive one where I would find myself getting up to walk around every so often to relieve the pain in my lower back. Oh, and they had mentioned missing parts due to the box being damaged (which has no bearing on the product itself); those particular items cannot be lost as they are attached to the chair and in a special pouch located on the back of the chair (see photo). They obviously didn't realize that.All-in-all, this is an excellent purchase for anyone who is looking at a new desk chair. The price is phenomenal for the quality and the amount of features. There is also a good amount of colors to choose from so you can better match your style and decor.

YT videos of this chair but was hesitant to order online but for $160 how bad could it be?Similar style chairs in Office Max start around $300 but with bonded leather which is commonly known to peel and tear over time.This is PU leather which is not as breathable but sturdy like vinyl without cracking or peeling.First off, assembly is extremely straight forward with incredible step by step instructions.  Hats off to whoever put it together.The seat is surprisingly comfortable and sturdy, as the YT reviews suggested but much more comfortable than I would’ve expected.  I needed a more firm and supportive chair so don’t expect to sink in and be plushy.Every video BASHED the speaker quality comparing it to laptop equivalence. I had low expectations and thought it was more of a gimmick but these are actually louder and having more bass than what YT videos would have you think.  Don’t expect full Bose type quality but for the size of the speakers I would compare it to a smaller JBL flip. These speakers DO NOT distort at high volumes or deep bass (my music of choice is EDM)My only complaint is the foot rest, I wouldn’t pay the money for it.  I’m 5”10 with slightly longer legs than normal and the footrest is more of a calf rest.  My feet hang off and I wish it could come out a few more inches.  The foot rest is not that sturdy and has some give. It’s not well crafted and not really worth using by if you’re under 5’10 than this May suit you well.All in all, exceptional quality, easy to assemble and I would definitely look into this as a really good alternative to the Respawn 110

exactly what I was looking for!  The assembly was a breeze thanks to the awesome manual that came with it.  It is very comfortable, and I love that it has such a wide recline range! The lumbar and head pillows are adjustable and are very supportive. The footstool is pretty decent, could be a bit longer for taller folks but it does okay, plus I don't plan to use that part too often.  The quality of the speakers is pretty good for the price of the chair and work great for meetings, watching YouTube, or streaming your favorite music. Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend.

商品の組み立ては説明書通りに作業をしていけば、簡単に組み立てできます。時間の多い、少ないは人によって違うと思いますので参考にはならないと思いますが、自分は２時間程度かかりました。椅子に座った感じは個人個人違うと思いますが、自分にはちょっと硬めに感じました。実は配達になった商品ですが、左のスピーカーに不具合があり、うまく音が出ませんでした。販売元にメールで問い合わせを行ったところ、土曜日だったのですが、すぐに連絡があり、２～３試してもらいたいとのことでした。指示通り試したみたのですが、改善されませんでした。そうするとすぐに「背もたれ」のみ代替え品を送付するとの連絡があり、倉庫が土日休みで月曜日の発送になるとのことでしたが、そのとおり火曜日には代替え品が配達になりました。代替え品は特に問題なく使用できています。品質管理をしっかりといいたいところですが、その後の対応は迅速・丁寧で素晴らしいと感じました。星を４としたのは品質管理の問題で-１です。

     Instead of returning it  decided to have it put together.  I was surprised it’s very comfortable for my back and has lots of extra like the leg lift, massager, back adjuster.  I have major spinal issues that need the back part to be straight up.  It was also easy to put together.  So far it’s working great  also I decided to leave The Arms off since they weren’t adjustable to go up.

                                                First of all,  sorry I had to add a background to the main pic but I didn't realized I had bunch of stuff around .. so let's jump to the details!First,  I gotta say this is a good chair for the amount paid for it,  I'm concerned about the durability of the foot rest,  it feels like it'll be the first thing that will break,  also the fabric ripped as I was sliding the arm rest while assembling it,  not the end of the world but these details prevent me from giving this item a 5 star rating.Assembly wasn't that difficult but it takes a good 15-20 mins, it would be super helpful if they would mark the bolt tray with the letter assigned on the manual,  again not the end of the world but it's all in the details of delivering a 5 star product.So far this is a decent chair for a budget price,  there are better chairs out there but with a higher range of price, this might be good for a young child/teen that knows how to take care of things.

put together at first but once u get the hang of it, it gets pretty easy.  The chair is very comfortable and nice. It is a bit heavy so definitely a 2 person job if youre on the smaller side. For what i paid it is a good chsir. Very sturdy. Some reviews say there was black stains on the chair…but one of those images was where u screw some of the parts together, so it wasnt a stain it was where you put it together. When i got my package some screws had like brown dust? I want to say rust, but the black paint was looking fine. So just keep an eye out for that. Mine didnt come with speakers

set up and very sturdy. The cushion is very comfy and my son loves the foot rest feature and how the chair adjusts from high to low and reclining. I can see him having this chair for a while.

                                 I like the chair but wish the arm rest was softer The back massager is great and you can adjust the back seat how you want it and the legs rest is good also

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Okay, I have to rescind the review I had originally written for this product. I thought it was really cute and that the problem of feeling like I was going to fall out of it would fix itself at some point. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. So here are my problems with it:1. The aforementioned feeling like I'm going to fall out of it. The whole thing tilts forward, even when I'm leaning back, even after tightening the forward tilt knob as tight as it goes. I can't pull the footrest out and use it as support or I will literally flip over forwards. The back wheel is lifting up off the ground and I am definitely not heavy enough for it to do that unless the structural integrity of the chair is seriously damaged. I've tried everything, including putting things under the front wheels to balance it out, because I really want to like this chair... but no amount of changing my posture will do it. If I so much as breathe in this chair I have to sit way back to make sure I don't fall out of it.2. The seat is so uncomfortable. The tilted-up bits on the left and right might be nice if they were cushioned, but they are hard metal and so painful against my thighs. I can't sit in the same spot for more than two or three minutes or I start seriously hurting to the point I'm probably going to bruise. You can feel the hard metal underneath digging into your legs.3. There is no way to lock the arms, so if you so much as bump one of the arms, it makes a horrible, jarring click and digs into your side one way or the other. They're also majorly loose even though I followed the instructions exactly and tightened everything as tight as possible.4. The instructions themselves are a mess. All pictures. I put the footrest on completely wrong because it doesn't even have a picture for doing it and injured myself several times trying to get it on. Some parts don't look like they do in the manual and you have to make your best guess and sometimes do trial and error. The base was so difficult, too, the manual makes it look like you're supposed to slide it in and that is not the case. I injured myself here, too, thinking I was just doing it wrong when in fact it was the manual that was wrong and I had to figure out how to get it in myself.Just overall the chair is insanely uncomfortable, which is such a shame, because it's absolutely adorable. At this point I just want my money back. What a waste. I should've known it was too cute to be true.

The cushions don't feel very padded and the hard arm rests are a suck, my elbow is already irritated from resting my arm on it long enough to type this review. BUT it's pretty to look at and the neck pillow is nice. I'm a bit confused by the flap in the back. It velcros under the chair so maybe pillow storage but it's be difficult to velcro is with something behind the flap.Its a cheap chair for a cheap price. I should've gone with the one with a lot more bottom cushion.

                                            I recently purchased this gaming chair for my 17-year-old son, who is 6 feet tall and has poor posture. We were looking for a chair that not only looked stylish but also provided the necessary support and comfort for long gaming sessions. This chair has exceeded our expectations in several ways:Stylish Design: The chair’s sleek and modern design fits perfectly in any gaming setup.Sturdy Build: The chair feels  sturdy and well-constructed. Adjustable Height: It allows my son to find the perfect seating position, which is crucial for his comfort and posture.Ergonomic Support: The ergonomic design of the chair is fantastic. My son feels much more comfortable sitting for extended periods.Overall, this gaming chair has been a great investment!

so comfy for me 😁. Easy to assemble. The size is roomy and it's very sturdy. No issues thank God!The price point is good as well compared to other ones out there. Back support is the best.

                            It is a really nice and comfortable chair. I gave 4 stars because it was rather tricky putting together, especially the back of the chair to the seat installment. It was worth the time it took overall as our son loves it. The back cushion support and headrest are a plus.  Reclines really far back which is also nice. If you have the time, the chair is worth it.

from Amazon but this one has frustrated/displeased me enough to break that trend. I'm 220 lbs and 6'0". I'm 66 yrs. old and have sat in hundreds of chairs like this one over the years. I've assembled them, used them for ages, and thrown them away after I've worn them out. If you're a short person you'll not have an issue with this chair. By short I mean no more than 5' probably. I set this chair to be at it's highest height as that's what is most comfortable for me. Unfortunately, as the day goes by it slowly sinks to the bottom height and I find my knees eventually crushing my chest. Now that's a slight exaggeration but you get the point.Yes, I know how to "lock" the mechanism. Every day, I use the handle to again lift the chair to its max height for the day's use, and then slowly but surely as time drags on it sinks to the bottom and becomes extremely uncomfortable and, essentially, unusable.I'd return it but the excessive difficulty putting it together, even with two people, makes the thought of disassembling it horrendous. And then to load it into a vehicle and actually wait in line somewhere to drop it off for return makes the process impossible.When it's at its best and standing tall this chair is extremely good, but give it an hour or so and it begins to become what, to me, is a very vociferous "DO NOT BUY" recommendation.One other minor irritation but a consistent one nonetheless are the arms. There is a rather large gap between the back of the arm and the back of the chair. If you wear shortsleeve shirts, and that's mandatory for me here in Florida, when you go to stand up your sleeve has a frequent tendency to get caught on the end of the arm causing some humorous gesticulations. A design flaw for me personally but probably won't be much of an issue for others.

is very comfortable. It is very easy to assemble. It also looks good. I like the function that it can lower the back all the way down and I can lay on it. I would recommend others to buy it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I've tested 3 Ergonomic Office Chairs, 5 Gaming Chairs and to be honest, this one is the best for under $300. I tested out a Stples chair of the same quality at $470.00 with taxes and I'm glad I bought this one.No, I am not getting paid to say this. I love this chair and I see a few negative reviews here, so I'd love to share my thoughts.PROS:- the lumbar support and pillow are great. It's not too hard, not too soft.- pillows are adjustable. If you really don't like them, 1. Remove them and 2. Buy a memory foam velcro pillow that clips on, for a car. It's the same thing and twice as comfortable, for only $30-50 each. Smart savings.- the construction feels great and the material is virtually the same of other gaming chairs rated at $400-600 range. If you want a perfect gaming chair, be prepared to spend $700-900. It may be a lot, sure, but think of how long you're gonna own a chair, and think of the back pain it'll save you from. I had a small blue chair with no support from age 13-28, so it's time to upgrade.- If your chair breaks in some way, there is limited warranty from the supplier and amazon. But keep in mind, a chair for only $150.00, is a risk you take. That's super cheap for what you get.- the chair reclines almost at a full 180 degrees (approximately 170), allowing you to lay flat. I love it.- armests are adjustable, up and down only, not side to side or left to right.- I have sat in the chair for 6 hours, doing homework and gaming and I love it. I am 6' 0" at 185lbs. The chair is good for me but if you are over 215lbs, you may want a slightly wider chair.CONS:- armests are only 2D, not 4D. This is expected for the price.- no footrest, but that doesn't matter. I've tried the footrests for a lot of these chairs and they suck. 1. They're not long enough, so your feet hang, as the footrest ends, 6" before your heel, 2. They're not well made. 3. What I did instead was buy a $130.00 ottoman with storage, non-foldable, on Amazon, and it's a perfect footrest which I can move around freely. I use the storage for my gaming controllers and the ottoman fits perfectly under my desk if I want more space. In case I can't post a link in a review, here's the product info. Name: "Tufted Leather Square Flip Top Storage Ottoman Cube Foot Rest, Black" sold by "H&B Luxuries" on Amazon.- a review I saw "oh the plastic piece of the side broke." Not sure how, as this is fastened via 1 screw. If your screw hole is too big, add 1 small washer and this will fix the problem. Mine was fine. 1. Test out any product you get and 2. If there are any issues, it's your job to return them and get a new one or a refund. Accidents do happen in manufacturing, but instead, I see people complain, and write a bad review LOL. That's your fault brother.- it'd be nice if this chair came in more colours, but I love the black as it blends with everything. White & black usually do. I got an all black chair myself.

              I updated my chair to this and honestly it's a really good chair for back posture. Only thing the arms could be a bit longer...Other than that really happy with this purchase!

Parts are not marked, including the screws, so no help there.  It's figureoutable, though.While this may be rated for 300#, nobody that weighed that much would fit in this.  It's probably wide enough, just barely, but it's very shallow.  It only comes to my upper thigh, I can't imagine being able to be comfortable if I had more junk in my trunk.The chair tilts well but the lumbar support can't be removed so, when tilting, it's quite uncomfortable.  That renders the tilt somewhat useless.The lumbar section does feel good, though.I think it's also lower than most office chairs.  I really should have measured all that.  I'll grab it from the hubs tomorrow and add it in after this posts.The seat cushion isn't bad.  Decently thick, medium-firm.Casters are light duty and roll about as well as any caster.

                                        I’m in love with this chair! It’s so comfy and makes sitting for hours so much easier. The lumbar support really helps my back, and the seat feels nice and soft but still supportive. Adjusting the height and recline is super smooth, and it was easy to put together. It’s perfect for my home office—looks great and feels even better! Totally worth it.
