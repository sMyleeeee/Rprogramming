Bike pedals easily, training wheels are sturdy, and is designed to delight a 4 year old.  Love that it came in a 14 inch size.  Seat and handlebars are simple to adjust if necessary.  The only thing I don’t like about the bike are the white wheels, which already look dirty.  Overall though this is a great buy for a first ride.",5,NA

She rode it all over the house before we could get her outside. The basket and the handlebars were a perfect addition for a pink/purple loving girl. It’s a light bike and easy to assemble. Breaks are easy to use. And she loves the bell.  We’ve had it for 6+ months and took it on a plane when we moved and it’s still going strong.  She loves riding it!",5,NA

It was surprisingly easy to assemble, says the bike mechanic dad who put it together. The birthday girl loved it.  All the cutesy touches makes this bike a hit. The only flaw is the training wheel bars are made of a less sturdy metal and more care was needed when attaching.  Though they seem to do just fine on the road.",5,NA
"7","Bicycle","Royalbaby Stargirl Kids Bike Girls","dj","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","I bought this bike for my daughter's 7th birthday and she absolutely loves it! It's a beautiful blue color with pink accents and a cute basket in the front. The bike is very sturdy and well-made, and it was easy to assemble with the instructions provided. The bike also comes with a kickstand, which is very convenient for parking and storage.My daughter enjoys riding this bike around the neighborhood and to the park. She says it's very comfortable and smooth, and she likes the adjustable seat and handlebars. The bike has both hand brakes and coaster brakes, which are easy to use and provide good control. The bike also has a bell, which she likes to ring to alert pedestrians and other bikers.The bike is a perfect size for her, and I think it will last her for a few years. It's not too heavy or bulky, but it's also not too small or flimsy. The bike is suitable for different terrains and weather conditions, and it has good traction and stability. The bike also has reflectors on the wheels and pedals, which make it more visible and safe.I'm very happy with this purchase and I would highly recommend this bike to anyone looking for a quality bike for their girl. It's a great value for the money, and it's a lot of fun to ride. My daughter says it's her favorite gift ever, and she can't wait to go on more adventures with her bike!",5,NA

Looks nice.  It's reasonably light weight.  Not quite used to the shifting yet, but the bike is pretty quick without much effort.  Took 5 minutes to set up with the tools provided.  Though, you're better off using a real screwdriver and wrenches if you have them.The only downside is the seat.  It's rock hard, and without rear shocks, it's pretty uncomfortable.",5,NA

"31","Bicycle","Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail Mountain Bike for Boys/Girls/Men/Women","Sneaky","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","Awesome for the price.","Bought this for my 10 yo for Christmas.  Bike took some time to assemble but came together pretty easily.  Issues:The wheels are not straight and contact the brake pads sporadically while riding, making a scrubbing sound.  I made significant adjustments to the brake pad spacing but could not easily dial it in to the spacing referenced in the manual - needed wider spacing to avoid contacting the tire.The derailleurs were not indexed properly.  I followed the instructions step by step to set the low and high limits, then adjusted the thumbscrews to adjust the indexing.  I spent 4 hours (not exaggerating) adjusting and could not get the shifting to work properly - it skipped gears, and the bike would often shift gears on its own while pedaling.  Front derailleur was trash, could never get it to shift into the smallest gear.  The shifters were “tight” especially for the front gearing, my son couldn’t even shift it to the smallest gear because it was so tight.Ultimately I decided to return it, too much wasted time trying to make it functional.  Don’t waste your time on this bike, it’s trash just like many of the other reviewers said.  I wish I’d listened to them, but I was attracted to the positive reviews and the price seemed reasonable.At the very least, don’t trash the box after buying it, because you can’t return it without the box.  I had to buy a $20 bike box just to return it after trashing the original box (which was damaged on the bottom).  Fortunately Amazon covered the cost of the bike box and made this return process pretty easy.",1,NA

I originally was going to purchase the 20 inch til I saw for a ""girl"" I assumed this meant a child. YES I am short 5 feet. So then I went looking for a 22 inch.I could not find one.Now my 2 brothers growing up had the sting ray cool looking Huffy bikes. So I strictly surfed HUFFY Mountain Bikes still NO 22 inch, what did I know, I have not ridden a bike in 37,38 years, lol, lol. The info on inches and heights was there right in front of me..This AWESOMELY made, relatively easy to put together, took about 1 1/2 hours>PERFECT!. I watched the video which clearly walks you through the entire process. OH My the Crisp Red color,The sleek cool looking awesomely light weight solid structured fit me to the TEEEEE...This Bike is NOW in my TOP 3 items I have ever purchased on Amazon..that I cherish the most..The cost is nothing compared to how I/We/You are going to feel proudly riding on this Bike.

"35","Bicycle","Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail Mountain Bike for Boys/Girls/Men/Women","Lynette","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars","EDIT 10/22 The seat broke. It keeps tilting back when I sit on it. I literally cannot tighten the nuts anymore. The seat is going to have to be replaced. Really pisses me off.This is a pretty good bike. I got this bike after spending years riding my mon's old Giant(which costs about $500 in today's money), and while it doesn't quite measure up to that one, it still feels pretty comfortable. It rides smoothly, and the gears are noticeably different from each other. I switch gears a lot when going against the wind or going up or down hill, so it was important the gears worked well.I brought it to a bike shop to put together instead of doing it myself to avoid any problems from poor assembly. Early on I had an issue with the right brake sticking, and I took it to the bike shop that put it together but it unstuck at that point and the bike shop couldn't see any problem. The brake hasn't stuck since, so it could just be that the bike needed breaking in.A bigger issue with the brakes is that they're simply too short. I can't comfortably rest my fingers on them when I'm riding (which you should always do to be safe). I can only really get one finger on them. The brakes are only half the size of the handle, and the inner part of the handle is taken up by the gear mechanism, so I can't put my hands any closer to the brakes without accidently changing the gears. Seeing as this is a women's bike, and women have smaller hands then men, this is strange. It's a minor issue though.Overall I'm really happy with this bike, especially considering I didn't have much of a choice since it seems there's a bike shortage because of the pandemic.",3,NA

"48","Bicycle","JOYSTAR Little Daisy Kids Bike for Girls Boys Ages 2-7 Years","Jim F.","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Overall a good bike for the grand daughter.","Where to start? Assembly was moving along fine until I got to installing the fenders. The two fenders are different, but the instructions lack enough detail to determine which goes where.  Then I was dismayed to discover that the lock nut that needed to be removed, in order to install the front fender, had been threaded on past it's lock point.  Much frustration and two hours later, I finally got it off, but the brake assembly mounting bolt was stripped.  The entire forward brake assembly had to be removed.  Fortunately, this is a training bike and also has a back-pedal brake.  The final insult to injury was that the instructions for mounting the rear reflector were just wrong. They didn't match the hard mount point on the bike at all.Recommendations for management:1. Update the assembly instructions. Most problems could have been avoided with more detailed / accurate instructions.2. Don't use lock nuts on an assembly like this, if you can't guarantee that the monkeys doing the preassembly won't overtighten them.UPDATE - 31 MAY 2024After submitting my initial review, the seller offered a full refund.  No conditions were mentioned.  Then they came back stating that the bicycle needed to be returned in order to receive the refund, and asked if I'd already assembled it.  As indicated in my initial review, it's already fully assembled.  My daughter's birthday is tomorrow, so we're out of time to fix this.  Reducing star rating to one.",1,NA

"74","Bicycle","HILAND 26 27.5 Inch Mountain Bike","Essential Sailing Industries","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024","","The reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because the gear selectors have low quality printing on them.

The various sizes (12, 14, and 16 inches) ensure that there’s a perfect fit for every child. The bike's design is delightful, with a colorful finish that appeals to both boys and girls. The included basket and bell add a touch of fun and practicality, making it an instant favorite among kids. Constructed from high-quality materials, the bike is both durable and safe.

"79","Bicycle","HILAND Girls Bike for Toddlers and Kids Ages 2-7 Years Old","Hartmann","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2024","","Pros:Ideal Size for Toddlers:The 12-inch wheels are the perfect size for children in the 2-4 year age range, offering a comfortable ride for young learners. The bike's lightweight design and low frame make it easy for toddlers to handle and get on and off.Stability with Training Wheels:The training wheels provide much-needed stability for beginners, helping young riders focus on pedaling without worrying about balance. It’s a great way for toddlers to gain confidence as they learn to ride.Fun Accessories:The bike includes a basket, bell, and rear rack, which add fun and functionality to the ride. The basket is perfect for carrying small toys or snacks, and the bell encourages kids to practice signaling or just adds to the enjoyment. The rear rack is mostly decorative but can also be used for light items.Sturdy Construction:The bike features a solid steel frame that can withstand the wear and tear typical of early childhood use. The tires provide adequate traction on smooth surfaces like sidewalks and bike paths.Cons:Longer Assembly Time (1 Hour):Assembly took about an hour, which is much longer than the expected ""90% preassembled"" claim. Although the bike comes mostly assembled, you’ll still need to attach the front wheel, pedals, handlebars, and adjust the seat. For parents hoping for a quick setup, this extra time required could be frustrating. The instructions can be a bit unclear at times, adding to the challenge.Limited Adjustability:The seat and handlebars are adjustable, but the range of adjustment is somewhat limited. Taller kids might outgrow this bike faster than expected. For children closer to the upper end of the 2-4 year range, the bike may not fit them comfortably for long.Training Wheels Hard to Remove:Like many bikes with training wheels, the process of removing them once your child is ready to ride without them can be a bit difficult. Some parents report that the training wheels don’t come off as easily as expected, making the transition to riding without them slower than desired.Not Suitable for Rough Terrain:The bike is designed primarily for smooth, flat surfaces. It won’t perform well on rough or uneven terrain, limiting its use to sidewalks, bike paths, and driveways.Overall Verdict:This 12-inch kids bike has a solid build and fun features, making it a good choice for toddlers just learning to ride. The 1-hour assembly time—much longer than the advertised ""90% preassembled"" claim—may be a dealbreaker for parents hoping for a quick setup. While the bike is mostly preassembled, the extra steps required to get it ready to ride, combined with unclear instructions, can make the process frustrating.Despite this, the bike offers stability with training wheels, fun accessories (like a basket and bell), and a durable frame that should hold up over time. It's a great option for young children, though the assembly time and limited adjustability for growing kids keep it from earning a higher rating.",3,NA

"116","Bicycle","Hiland 20 Inch Kids Mountain Bike for Boys","George C","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","QUALITY/CONDITION/CONTENT","This is the first ""Bike-in-a-Box"" that I have ever purchased (Hiland Redeem in Green). All of my bikes have always been purchased from a brick-and-mortar store. Due to COVID, this was my only choice to get my son his present. The item arrived with a hole in side of the box, and the front axle was poking out. Luckily, nothing was damaged. Everything else looked to be intact, and of course there were no instructions. Being the bike mechanic for all the kids in the neighborhood, I didn't need the directions. I agree with all of the other reviewers that this bike needs to be assembled and tuned up from top to bottom.Here is what I experienced: Some parts (stem, wheels, chain) were very tight; the crank was unusually loose and later discovered during a test ride. The stem was so tight, it would not rotate. This had to be fixed before the handlebars were mounted. It was loosened, adjusted, and realigned. Then the handlebars were mounted. While adjusting the cable for the front brakes, the cable loop (which is simply spot welded) broke off. This was easily fixed with a cable tie. Front and rear axles needed to be loosened a bit to rotate freely. I also checked to make sure they were greased (luckily they were). The rear wheel was adjusted so tight, that the chain would most likely snap. I loosen the steel nut on the adjusting bolt (near the cassette) to give the chain a small amount of play. The rear axle pegs were then tightened, and the chain tension rechecked. The rear brake cable was adjusted so that it fed into the clamp from the outside. This allowed for proper clearance between the bare cable and the seat tube. During the test ride, the crank nut loosened to where I was able to spin it with my fingers. The chain wheel was also wobbling. I removed the crank nut completely to get access to the fasteners by the chain wheel. Once every nut on the crank was tightened back up, I rode the bike again. This bike rides fine, and is not too heavy (about 30 lbs.).  The brakes work fine, but the pads are terrible. If I plan to relive my ""Rad"" (the Hal Needham movie) days, I will have to swap the pads for some Kool Stops. I am giving this item four stars because it is essentially a China knock-off of the Mongoose Legion, but it does the job. The price (costs more than a Mongoose!?) is only inflated because of COVID.",4,NA
"117","Bicycle","Hiland 20 Inch Kids Mountain Bike for Boys","George C","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","This bike was poorly made. I purchased the first time and after putting together realized both wheels (not tires) were warped. This made it impossible to ride because 1) the bike would wobble and 2) the brakes would rub on half the wheel and then not touch when braking on the other half of the wheel.I returned the bike and requested a replacement. The replacement arrived within a week and the wheel problem was correct. I put the bike together and upon airing up the tires realized the back had a leak. I ordered an inner tube for it and replaced it. I pumped up the tire. Immediately the tire had a leak again. I compared the two leaking inner tubes and the leak was in the same place. I removed the tire from the wheel to inspect and discovered that several of the wheel spokes, which are attached to the inner side of the wheel (where the inner tube rests between the wheel and tire) were jagged and sharp, which was puncturing the tube when inflated.Extremely poor quality and unsafe for a child.

"121","Bicycle","Hiland 20 Inch Kids Mountain Bike for Boys","JF","Reviewed in Canada on October 17, 2024","","First and foremost, I should note that you need to know something about bike maintenance....well, actually....you need to know everything about bike maintenance if you're planning on buying this for your child and putting it together yourself. If you don't know how to maintain a bike, I suggest taking it to a bike store to getting it checked. Specifically (based on my experience putting two of these together now), at the very least you should look out for the following issues that I found on either both, or one or the other of the two bikes that I purchased for my kids:1. Brake cables not oiled (unexpected).2. Brake cables not properly adjusted (somewhat expected, but one was really, really off).3. Brake pad adjustments required after installing the front wheel (expected).4. Grease various parts (expected - handle bar joints, seat post. Unexpected - kickstand spring/mechanism).5. Check tightness of brake hand levers (expected, I guess).6. Fully deflate and reposition inner tube inside the tire (unexpected).7. Remove buckle from rear wheel!!! (Yikes - that was totally unexpected - see the video).8. Check every bolt on the bike to ensure reasonable tightness for the purpose (expected, I guess, and there was one loose bolt on the rear wheel, so please do check).9. Oil bike chain and inflate tires (totally expected).In essence, it seems that there is not a great deal of concern about the final stages of manufacturing of these bikes, i.e., the stage where they're basically putting all the parts together. Having said that, the bike design is quite good and suitable for normal bike riding (not for tricks, freestyle, racing, etc.). The manual that came with the bikes was not specific for this model, but was general for several of the models that they sell. It was well-written and generally easy to comprehend. The paintwork, tires, frame construction, and individual components (brake parts, pedals, kick stand, handlebar grips, seat cushion, paint on the rims) are all of good quality for the cost of the bike. I do have a concern about the quality of the rear wheel hub as I'm certain that they are running a little too noisy (suggesting a lack of grease or poor quality components - listen carefully to the lower-pitched, grinding sound in the video - that sound is coming from the wheel hub, not from something rubbing against the rim or tire). I suspect that they will last at least a couple of years so I'm not too concerned about that. It may be that they are meant to be noisy, although the noisy rear hub, combined with the buckle in one of the rear wheels (see video) just makes me wonder again about the final stage of manufacturing of these bikes. OK, overall, not a bad bike for the price, but be prepared to put in some effort to ensure a safe ride for your child or grandchild.Bike size advice: My kids are both nine years old and about 54"" and 52"" tall, and the bikes work well for both of them. I expect that they'll get about one to two years of use out of the bikes. So the 42"" - 56"" recommendation, and 5 - 9 year age group seems reasonable. However, I do think (but am not certain) that the average 5 year old would be a little too small to handle this bike size. For example, I feel that the handlebars would be sitting a little too high for a typical 5 year old, and I also feel that the brake levers would be a little too difficult for a 5 year old's hands to reach comfortably. Again, I stand corrected on this. Worst case scenario, if it is too small you can always store it for later use.  I think the perfect age for this bike would be a seven year old, average-size kid, and would end up getting about 3 years of good use out of it.",5,NA
