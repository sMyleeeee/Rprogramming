Ojo con el tamaño, puede ser demasiado grande para escritorios estándar y uno tendría que poner el monitor de la computadora encima del pad, pero si se tiene en cuenta esto, es un muy buen producto. Tengo con él apenas unos 6 meses pero se nota que va a durar mucho tiempo; muy buenos materiales.

Compared to my old bulky mouse pad with the leaking gel wrist rest support, this one is shaped ergonomically with a smaller but very adequate wrist rest support that allows my wrist to pivot more effectively to move the mouse efficiently. I love the non-slip, smaller profile base. The cloth surface of the mouse pad is smooth with a very attractive graphic design that suits me to a 'T'. The two-pack pads accommodate two office locations and have now become a sort of 'signature' of my office spaces. Great quality, perfect price point, tremendous value -- I highly recommend.

As you can see, my wrist lays in a straight line which has been alleviating my wrist pain since this is the first ergonomic mouse pad I have ever purchased. The cooling gel is no joke, either. Every time my wrist lays on it, its nice and cool to the touch, a very soft gel-like feel.The design options are super cute also, and don't look to be low quality at all.The no-slip grip on the bottom has been working out quite well as this mouse pad STAYS IN PLACE! It's actually a matter of having to pick up the whole thing and move it when necessary as it seriously doesn't go anywhere.My only concern for this product would be the future of the no-slip bottom since I would anticipate the material on the bottom picking up dust and dirt over time, but i'm sure this could be fixed with some spot cleaning and really is not a deal-breaker for the aesthetic and ergonomic aspects this product offers.Overall, a very good mousepad for not a ton of money and one I highly reccomend!",5,NA

"50","MousePad","SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad - XXL Thick Cloth - Sized to Cover Desks","Film Rat","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023","","I rather like this mousepad despite owning more expensive options. From a performance standpoint, it is basically exactly how I want my mousepad for a tac shooter. There is very little startup friction in spite of the decently controlled dynamic friction/glide, which makes this pad very easy to flick while still being able to microadjust. It's a very confident pad in terms of aim, but there are some downsides I should note.There are a few problems with the material. Namely, it has a very distinct odor. This is the mold release that is used to cast the rubber base. It actually left a residual coat on my desk that I had to wipe off after removing the pad. The actual surface however is decently smooth and free of imperfections, time will tell how well it holds up.The pad would be very ergonomic if not for the raised stitching. The stitching sits a good mm over the rest of the mousepad, so it digs into your arm and causes quite a bit of irritation. I have to leave this pad over the edge so that the stitching doesn't keep scratching my arm. Aside from a comfort standpoint, the stitching also interferes with the mouse when you graze the edge. With other mousepads, the stitching is low enough that your mouse will still glide fine until you practically run it off the pad. This translates to a larger usable area on the mousepad.I actually think the standard QCK is a better purchase due to the lack of raised stitching alone. Yes, it won't last as long as the QCK Edge, but you get a more comfortable mousepad with a larger usable area.",4,NA

I recently put contact paper on my desk to liven it up a bit, but realized my mouse would NOT glide properly on it. I found this mousepad and I appreciated the look, support, and price. When it arrived, I didn’t notice a strong smell at all; it smells like what I imagine a mousepad is to smell like haha. I really like the ergonomic support, the size, and the softness of the pad, and it works really well for my mouse! One of the main reasons why I don’t like many mousepads is the backing. This one has an excellent grip; it’s almost like it’s glued down to my desk, so there is no slipping, just be sure to remove the protective plastic on the back.",5,NA

The black shows everything as anyone who has ever had a black mouse pad knows, but that is my only and very picky criticism. For the price they are basically disposable.

I'm using it with a wireless mouse and my mouse glides smoothly across its surface, where it was difficult to move before. My only issue with it is it doesn't always stay in place during extensive use, it can be easy to accidentally move with the palm of my hand. But it's hard to complain for $5, and having 2 extras is nice for when this one eventually wears down.",5,NA

"82","MousePad","Japanese Sea Wave Large Mouse Pad, Anime Black Gaming","Hannah Fox","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024","","Absolutely fits the aesthetic I'm going for with my setup currently, which is a solid black with accent color pops. My mouse glides over it perfectly and without any stutter or excess movement, and my keyboard doesn't move at all; plus, it's got my favorite piece of artwork on it. Absolutely worth it -- it might be budget priced, but it doesn't look or feel like it's a budget option.",5,NA

Because I am sitting considerably lower than most desk chair/desk situations, I needed something to take the pressure off the heal of my hand, which gets really sore after a day of writing. This thing has ample padding for that... and the difference in densities due to the slope makes it really versitile when I need to adjust into a different position. Can't wait to try it out in a ""normal"" setting, but it looks like the high point will comfortably hit the small of my wrist.Also, aesthetically, it looks great with the Logitech Lift ergonomic mouse.
